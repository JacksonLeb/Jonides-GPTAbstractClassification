The effect of temporal discontinuity on visual search was assessed by presenting
a display in which one item had an abrupt onset, while other items were
introduced by gradually removing line segments that camouflaged them. We
hypothesized that an abrupt onset in a visual display would capture visual
attention, giving this item a processing advantage over items lacking an abrupt
leading edge. This prediction was confirmed in Experiment 1. We designed a
second experiment to ensure that this finding was due to attentional factors rather
than to sensory or perceptual ones. Experiment 3 replicated Experiment 1 and
demonstrated that the procedure used to avoid abrupt onset—camouflage re-
moval—did not require a gradual waveform. Implications of these findings for
theories of attention are discussed.
