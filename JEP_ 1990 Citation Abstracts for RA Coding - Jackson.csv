TBD,,Adria,Jackson,1,Voluntary attention increases perceived spatial frequency,"Voluntary covert attention selects relevant sensory information for prioritized processing. The behavioral and neural consequences of such selection have been extensively documented, but its phenomenology has received little empirical investigation. Involuntary attention increases perceived spatial frequency (Gobell & Carrasco, 2005), but involuntary attention can differ from voluntary attention in its effects on performance in tasks mediated by spatial resolution (Yeshurun, Montagna, & Carrasco, 2008). Therefore, we ask whether voluntary attention affects the subjective appearance of spatial frequency-a fundamental dimension of visual perception underlying spatial resolution. We used a demanding rapid serial visual presentation task to direct voluntary attention and measured perceived spatial frequency at the attended and unattended locations. Attention increased the perceived spatial frequency of suprathreshold stimuli and also improved performance on a concurrent orientation discrimination task. In the control experiment, we ruled out response bias as an alternative account by using a lengthened interstimulus interval, which allows observers to disengage attention from the cued location. In contrast to the main experiment, the observers showed neither increased perceived spatial frequency nor improved orientation discrimination at the attended location. Thus, this study establishes that voluntary attention increases perceived spatial frequency. This phenomenological consequence links behavioral and neurophysiological studies on the effects of attention.",Article,2010,"Abrams, J; Barbot, A; Carrasco, M",ATTENTION PERCEPTION & PSYCHOPHYSICS,AUG,10.3758/APP.72.6.1510,http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/APP.72.6.1510,
TBD,,Adria,Jackson,2,Onset but not offset of irrelevant motion disrupts inhibition of return,"In seven experiments, subjects were slower to detect targets in cued static objects than in uncued static objects, revealing inhibition of return (IOR). This occurred regardless of the presence or absence of continuous motion of other, task-irrelevant objects in the display. However, if the motion of the irrelevant objects began during the interval between cue and target, the amount of IOR was considerably reduced. Offset of motion during the cue-target interval had no effect. Implications for IOR, object perception, and attentional capture are discussed.",Article,2005,"Abrams, RA; Christ, SE",PERCEPTION & PSYCHOPHYSICS,NOV,10.3758/BF03193650,http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/BF03193650,
TBD,,Adria,Jackson,3,Motion onset captures attention,"Although visual motion may seem salient, motion per se does not automatically attract attention. We show here, however that the onset of motion does indeed attract attention. In three experiments, subjects identified target letters in displays that contained targets and distractors. There was no advantage for moving letters among static ones, but there was an advantage for objects that had recently started to move despite the fact that the motion was uninformative. If some additional time was allowed to elapse after motion onset, inhibition of return slowed responding to the item that had started to move-a further sign that the motion onset had captured attention. Finally, detection of target letters was found to be independent of the number of distractors in the display if the target had undergone motion onset, also indicative of attentional capture. We discuss the adaptive significance of sensitivity to onsets in the presence of a relative insensitivity to ongoing motion.",Article,2003,"Abrams, RA; Christ, SE",PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE,SEP,10.1111/1467-9280.01458,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-9280.01458,
TBD,,Adria,Jackson,4,Object-based visual attention with endogenous orienting,"In a series of experiments, we examined covert orienting using endogenous cuing, in which attention is voluntarily directed toward a peripheral location. In one experiment, subjects were cued to attend to one end of an oblong object. They then detected targets on the cued object or elsewhere. In another experiment, subjects provided judgments of the relative temporal order of two flashes after their attention had moved endogenously. In a third experiment, subjects were directed to attend to an empty spatial location and subsequently discriminated features of objects that appeared at or near the locus of attention. In each of these situations, attentional orienting was object based, in the sense that non-attended locations that were on the cued object had an advantage over non-attended locations that were not on the object. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for object-based representations and the differences between exogenous and endogenous orienting of attention.",Article,2000,"Abrams, RA; Law, MB",PERCEPTION & PSYCHOPHYSICS,MAY,10.3758/BF03206925,http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/BF03206925,
TBD,,Adria,Jackson,5,Alcohol effects on inhibitory control of attention: distinguishing between intentional and automatic mechanisms,"Rationale Recent research has begun to explore the possibility that inhibitory mechanisms of selective attention are particularly susceptible to the impairing effects of moderate doses of alcohol. However, literature also suggests that automatic processes might be more resistant to this impairing effect than controlled processes. Objective The present study used a delayed ocular response task and a saccadic interference task to examine the effects of alcohol on both intentionally controlled and automatic inhibitory influences on selective attention. Materials and methods Twelve healthy adults performed both tasks under three doses of alcohol (0.0, 0.45, and 0.65 g/kg). Results The results showed that alcohol reduced intentional inhibitory control over selective attention but had no effect on automatic inhibitory influences. Conclusion The present investigation marks the first effort to directly compare alcohol effects on automatic and intentional inhibitory mechanisms of visual attention. The results suggest that attentional processes dependent on intentional inhibitory control may be more susceptible to the impairing effects of a moderate dose of alcohol than processes dependent on automatic inhibition.",Article,2006,"Abroms, BD; Gottlob, LR; Fillmore, MT",PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,OCT,10.1007/s00213-006-0524-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00213-006-0524-y,
TBD,,Adria,Jackson,6,Real and implied motion at the center of gaze,"Even though the dynamicity of our environment is a given, much of what we know on fixation selection comes from studies of static scene viewing. We performed a direct comparison of fixation selection on static and dynamic visual stimuli and investigated how far identical mechanisms drive these. We recorded eye movements while participants viewed movie clips of natural scenery and static frames taken from the same movies. Both were presented in the same high spatial resolution (1080 X 1920 pixels). The static condition allowed us to check whether local movement features computed from movies are salient even when presented as single frames. We observed that during the first second of viewing, movement and static features are equally salient in both conditions. Furthermore, predictability of fixations based on movement features decreased faster when viewing static frames as compared with viewing movie clips. Yet even during the later portion of static-frame viewing, the predictive value of movement features was still high above chance. Moreover, we demonstrated that, whereas the sets of movement and static features were statistically dependent within these sets, respectively, no dependence was observed between the two sets. Based on these results, we argue that implied motion is predictive of fixation similarly to real movement and that the onset of motion in natural stimuli is more salient than ongoing movement is. The present results allow us to address to what extent and when static image viewing is similar to the perception of a dynamic environment.",Article,2014,"Açik, A; Bartel, A; König, P",JOURNAL OF VISION,,10.1167/14.1.2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1167/14.1.2,
TBD,,Adria,Jackson,7,Preparing for perception and action (II):: Automatic and effortful processes in response cueing,"In this paper we tested the automatic-effortful processing assumption of the Grouping Model. According to the Grouping Model, left-right cues are pull cues and inner-outer cues are push cues, evoking exogenous and endogenous control, respectively. In a series of four experiments we manipulated the characteristics of the cues: Onset vs. no-onset cues, spatial vs. symbolic cues, valid vs. invalid cues. The results consistently showed a dissociation between left-right and inner-outer cues. Together, the present findings provide converging evidence for the notion that left-right cues induce a fast, automatic selection of the cued responses, whereas inner-outer cues need slower, effortful processes to establish a selective preparatory set.",Article,2005,"Adam, JJ; Hommel, B; Umiltà, C",VISUAL COGNITION,NOV,10.1080/13506280444000779,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13506280444000779,
TBD,,Adria,Jackson,8,The Effect of Transient Location on the Resolution of Bistable Visual and Audiovisual Motion Sequences,"We examined the attention and inference accounts of audiovisual perception using the stream/bounce display, a visual stimulus wherein two identical objects move toward each other, completely superimpose, then move apart. This display has two candidate percepts: stream past each other or bounce off each other. Presented without additional visual or auditory transients, the motion sequence tends to yield the streaming percept, but when coupled with a tone or flash at the point of coincidence, the response bias flips toward bouncing. We explored two competing accounts of this effect: the attentional hypothesis and the inference hypothesis. Participants watched a series of motion sequences where a transient, when present, occurred at the moment of coincidence either colocalised with the motion sequence (congruent presentation) or on the opposite side of the display (incongruent presentation). Assuming the spotlight or zoom lens metaphor, an attentional account predicts that incongruent presentations should be associated with a higher percentage of bouncing responses than congruent presentations, while the inferential account predicts the opposite effect. No effect was found for tone-only trials. However, in trials containing a visual transient, results showed higher proportions of bounce responses within congruent over incongruent presentations, favouring the inference hypothesis over a spotlight or zoom lens attentional account.",Article,2018,"Adams, KL; Grove, PM",PERCEPTION,SEP,10.1177/0301006618788796,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0301006618788796,
TBD,,Adria,Jackson,9,Visual Working Memory Supports the Inhibition of Previously Processed Information: Evidence From Preview Search,"In four experiments we assessed whether visual working memory (VWM) maintains a record of previously processed visual information, allowing old information to be inhibited, and new information to be prioritized. Specifically, we evaluated whether VWM contributes to the inhibition (i.e., visual marking) of previewed distractors in a preview search. We evaluated this proposal by testing three predictions. First, Experiments 1 and 2 demonstrate that preview inhibition is more effective when the number of previewed distractors is below VWM capacity than above; an effect that can only be observed at small preview set sizes (Experiment 2A) and when observers are allowed to move their eyes freely (Experiment 213). Second, Experiment 3 shows that, when quantified as the number of inhibited distractors, the magnitude of the preview effect is stable across different search difficulties. Third, Experiment 4 demonstrates that individual differences in preview inhibition are correlated with individual differences in VWM capacity. These findings provide converging evidence that VWM supports the inhibition of previewed distractors. More generally, these findings demonstrate how VWM contributes to the efficiency of human visual information processing-VWM prioritizes new information by inhibiting old information from being reselected for attention.",Article,2012,"Al-Aidroos, N; Emrich, SM; Ferber, S; Pratt, J",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-HUMAN PERCEPTION AND PERFORMANCE,JUN,10.1037/a0025707,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0025707,
TBD,,Adria,Jackson,10,Attentional control settings prevent abrupt onsets from capturing visual spatial attention,"When a visual distractor appears earlier than a visual target in a target-detection task, response time is faster if the distractor appears at the same location as the target. When a visual distractor appears concurrently with a visual target in a target-detection task, response time is slowed relative to when no distractor is presented. Both effects have been taken as evidence of the capture of visual spatial attention, yet capture by early distractors is contingent on top-down attentional control settings (ACSs), and capture by concurrent distractors is not. The present study evaluated whether this incongruity is attributable to the timing of distractors (earlier than vs. concurrently with the target), or to the employed comparisons (same location/different location vs. distractor/no distractor). Using a task that presented both early and concurrent distractors, we observed that, regardless of timing, capture was contingent on ACSs when assessed by the same-location/different-location comparison. This result suggests that, although irrelevant stimuli cause nonspatial purely stimulus-driven effects, the capture of visual spatial attention is contingent on ACSs.",Article,2010,"Al-Aidroos, N; Harrison, S; Pratt, J",QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY,,10.1080/17470210903150738,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17470210903150738,
TBD,,Adria,Jackson,11,Top-down control in time and space: Evidence from saccadic latencies and trajectories,"Visual distractors disrupt the production of saccadic eye movements temporally, by increasing saccade latency, and spatially, by biasing the trajectory of the movement. The present research investigated the extent to which top-down control can be exerted over these two forms of oculomotor capture. In two experiments, people were instructed to make target directed saccades in the presence of distractors, and temporal and spatial capture were assessed simultaneously by measuring saccade latency and saccade trajectory curvature, respectively. In Experiment 1, an attentional control set manipulation was employed, resulting in the elimination of temporal capture, but only an attenuation of spatial capture. In Experiment 2, foreknowledge of the target location caused an attenuation of temporal capture but an enhancement of spatial capture. These results suggest that, whereas temporal capture is contingent on top-down control, the spatial component of capture is stimulus-driven.",Article,2010,"Al-Aidroos, N; Pratt, J",VISUAL COGNITION,,10.1080/13506280802456939,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13506280802456939,
TBD,,Adria,Jackson,12,A neural marker of content-specific active ignoring,"The ability to attend to relevant events and to ignore irrelevant stimuli is crucial to survival. Theories disagree on whether this ability is dependent solely on increased neural activation for relevant items or whether active ignoring can also play a role. The authors examined the active ignoring of stimuli using a preview search procedure, where irrelevant faces appeared prior to relevant house stimuli. They found increased activation in brain regions associated with spatial memory and in content-specific face-processing areas when participants ignored the irrelevant faces. Differences arose even on trials when only previewed faces appeared, and the magnitude of these differences predicted how well faces were ignored in search. Activation associated with active ignoring decreased when a secondary task was imposed during the preview. The data reveal a neural marker for the process of actively ignoring the content and locations of irrelevant stimuli.",Article,2008,"Allen, HA; Humphreys, GW; Matthews, PM",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-HUMAN PERCEPTION AND PERFORMANCE,APR,10.1037/0096-1523.34.2.286,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0096-1523.34.2.286,
TBD,,Adria,Jackson,13,Subitization and attentional engagement by transient stimuli,"A series of experiments investigated the visual selection of moving and static items during enumeration. Small numbers of visual targets can be enumerated with little increase in reaction time and error with set size, a process referred to as 'subitization'. The number of items that can be 'subitized' is typically between one and four and known as the subitization range. This study looked for evidence of subitizing of subsets of items presented on a computer display. Fast and accurate enumeration was found for random configurations of moving targets even when presented among static distracters. This was not the case for static targets presented among moving or transient distracters. RTs to these targets were longer and showed a steady increase in RT with target number, even in the subitization range. However, when static targets and moving distracters were presented foveally, fast enumeration/subitization of the static targets was again possible. This was not due to reduced inter-item spacing, since linear effects of the number of targets still emerged when stimuli were presented peripherally but the size-spacing ratio was matched to the foveal presentations. There was indication that instead performance reflected perceived differences in movement speed for stimuli presented in parafoveal and more peripheral retinal regions. In support of this, subitization of static items improved as the movement speed of the distracters increased. The data suggest that the processes supporting subitization are highly sensitive to dynamic stimuli and depend on the ease of segmentation between static and moving arrays.",Article; Proceedings Paper,2004,"Alston, L; Humphreys, GW",SPATIAL VISION,,10.1163/156856804322778251,http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/156856804322778251,

Methods: Twelve visually normal, young adult subjects participated in the experiments. Horizontal eye position was monitored as subjects attempted to track target step displacements in the presence of either single or multiple brief flashes of light in the visual field.

TBD,,Adria,Jackson,15,Context matters: Cortical rhythms in infants across baseline and play,"This study uses electroencephalography (EEG) to examine infants' cortical activity during baseline while they watched a dynamic audiovisual display and while engaged in play with an object and parent. Fifty-five 6- to 12-month-old infants participated in both baseline and play with their mother. We hypothesized that the baseline task recruits relatively more exogenous attention due to the dynamic audiovisual task, while the play task recruits relatively more endogenous attention when exploring the toy. We expected higher frontal theta and alpha power during play, reflecting higher endogenous control of attention compared to the baseline task. We expected the faster rhythms, beta and gamma, to have higher power during baseline at frontal locations, reflecting the salient attention-grabbing (exogenous) attributes of the baseline task in comparison to play. We also examined changes in parietal power between contexts. Our results were consistent with the expectations. Theta (3-6 Hz) and alpha (6-9 Hz) power were higher at frontal sites (Fp1/Fp2) during play relative to baseline. Beta (9-30 Hz) and gamma (30-50 Hz) power were higher at frontal (Fp1/Fp2) and frontal medial sites (F3/F4) during baseline relative to play. Alpha power was higher during baseline at frontal medial sites (F3/F4) relative to play. Beta and gamma power was higher during play at parietal sites (P3/P4). The results are discussed in terms of the potential role of different cortical rhythms over the scalp as they respond to relative endogenous and exogenous attentional demands.",Article,2022,"Anderson, AJ; Perone, S; Gartstein, MA",INFANT BEHAVIOR & DEVELOPMENT,FEB,10.1016/j.infbeh.2021.101665,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.infbeh.2021.101665,
TBD,,Adria,Jackson,16,There is no such thing as attention,"Given that the core issues of attention research have been recognized for millenia, we do not know as much about attention as we should. I argue that the reasons for this failure are (1) we create spurious dichotomies, (2) we reify attention, treating it as a cause, when it is an effect, and (3) we equate a collection of facts with a theory. In order to correct these errors, we need a new technical vocabulary that allows for attentional effects to be continuously distributed, rather than merely present or absent, and that provides a basis for quantitative behavioral predictions that map onto neural substrates. The terminology of the Bayesian decision process has already proved useful for structuring conceptual discussions in other psychological domains, such as perception and decision making under uncertainty, and it had demonstrated early success in the domain of attention. By rejecting a reified, causal conception of attention, in favor of theories that produce attentional effects as consequences, psychologists will be able to conduct more definitive experiments. Such conceptual advances will then enhance the productivity of neuroscientists by allowing them to concentrate their data collection efforts on the richest soil.",Article,2011,"Anderson, B",FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,,10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00246,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00246,
TBD,,Adria,Jackson,17,Neurobiology of value-driven attention,"What we pay attention to is influenced by reward learning. Converging evidence points to the idea that associative reward learning changes how visual stimuli are processed in the brain, rendering learned reward cues difficult to ignore. Behavioral evidence distinguishes value-driven attention from other established control mechanisms, suggesting a distinct underlying neurobiological process. Recently, studies have begun to explore the neural substrates of this value-driven attention mechanism. Here, I review the progress that has been made in this area, and synthesize the findings to provide an integrative account of the neurobiology of value-driven attention. The proposed account can explain both attentional capture by previously rewarded targets and the modulatory effect of reward on priming, as well as the decoupling of reward history and prior task relevance in value-driven attention.",Review,2019,"Anderson, BA",CURRENT OPINION IN PSYCHOLOGY,OCT,10.1016/j.copsyc.2018.11.004,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.copsyc.2018.11.004,

Evidence from divided attention costs,"Four studies examined the effects of divided attention in younger and older adults. Attention was divided at encoding or retrieval in free recall (Experiment 1), cued recall (Experiments 2 and 3), and recognition (Experiment 4). Dividing attention at encoding disrupted memory performance equally for the two age groups; by contrast, for both age groups, dividing attention at retrieval had little or no effect on memory performance. Secondary task reaction times (RTs) were slowed to a greater extent for the older adults than for the younger adults, especially at retrieval. Age-related differences in RT costs at retrieval were largest in free recall, smaller in cued recall, and smallest in recognition.

TBD,,Adria,Jackson,19,Top-down contingencies in peripheral cuing: The roles of color and location,"According to contingent-processing accounts, peripheral cuing effects are due to the cues' inadvertent selection for processing by control settings set up for targets (e.g., C. L. Folk, R. W. Remington, & J. C. Johnston, 1992). Consequently, cues similar to targets should have stronger effects than do dissimilar cues. In the current study, this prediction is confirmed for cue-target combinations similar or dissimilar in the static features of color (Experiments 1-3) and location (Experiment 4), even when both cues and targets share the dynamic feature of abrupt onset. Perceptual priming (Experiment 2) and reallocation of attention did not account for similar-dissimilar differences (Experiments 3 and 4). The results are best explained by top-down-contingent attentional effects of the similar cues. Implications for bottom-up accounts of peripheral cuing effects are discussed.",Article,2003,"Ansorge, U; Heumann, M",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-HUMAN PERCEPTION AND PERFORMANCE,OCT,10.1037/0096-1523.29.5.937,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0096-1523.29.5.937,
TBD,,Adria,Jackson,20,Divided visuo-spatial attention systems with total and anterior callosotomy,"The role of the corpus callosum in the inter-hemispheric integration of the visuo-spatial attention system, was investigated in patients with a total callosotomy or with an anterior callosal section. Subjects produced simple reaction times (RTs) to visual targets shown to the left or right visual hemifield. Preceding the target by an interval of 500 ms, arrow cues predicting the target location were shown left and right of the point of ocular fixation. For a majority of total and anterior callosotomy patients, results with valid focused cues (both arrows pointing to the target location) and with divided-attention cues (arrows pointing away from fixation) did not differ and both conditions produced shorter RTs than with neutral cues (equal signs). In contrast, neurologically intact subjects showed equal RTs with divided-attention and neutral cues, whereas valid focused cues produced reduced RTs relative to neutral cues. These results indicate that most split-brains, in contrast to normal observers, are capable of directing their attention to left and right visual field locations simultaneously, and therefore that each cerebral hemisphere controls its own visuo-spatial attention mechanism.

TBD,,Adria,Jackson,21,The effect of stimulus availability on task choice in voluntary task switching,"The voluntary task switching paradigm allows subjects to choose which task to perform on each trial in a stimulus environment affording multiple tasks. The present study examined the effect of stimulus availability on task choice. Subjects viewed displays containing a digit and a letter and performed either an even/odd or a consonant/vowel judgment on each trial. The target stimuli appeared with a stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) of 0, 50, 100, or 150 msec. The probability of performing the task associated with Stimulus 1 increased as SOA increased, indicating an effect of external or stimulus-driven factors on task choice. This effect of stimulus availability on task choice was greater when the response-stimulus interval was 400 msec than when it was 2,000 msec. This interaction of preparation interval and stimulus availability is explained within a model of task choice that includes both internal processes and external influences.",Article,2008,"Arrington, CM",MEMORY & COGNITION,JUL,10.3758/MC.36.5.991,http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/MC.36.5.991,
TBD,,Adria,Jackson,22,Rethinking volitional control over task choice in multitask environments: Use of a stimulus set selection strategy in voluntary task switching,"Under conditions of volitional control in multitask environments, subjects may engage in a variety of strategies to guide task selection. The current research examines whether subjects may sometimes use a top-down control strategy of selecting a task-irrelevant stimulus dimension, such as location, to guide task selection. We term this approach a stimulus set selection strategy. Using a voluntary task switching procedure, subjects voluntarily switched between categorizing letter and number stimuli that appeared in two, four, or eight possible target locations. Effects of stimulus availability, manipulated by varying the stimulus onset asynchrony between the two target stimuli, and location repetition were analysed to assess the use of a stimulus set selection strategy. Considered across position condition, Experiment 1 showed effects of both stimulus availability and location repetition on task choice suggesting that only in the 2-position condition, where selection based on location always results in a target at the selected location, subjects may have been using a stimulus set selection strategy on some trials. Experiment 2 replicated and extended these findings in a visually more cluttered environment. These results indicate that, contrary to current models of task selection in voluntary task switching, the top-down control of task selection may occur in the absence of the formation of an intention to perform a particular task.",Article,2015,"Arrington, CM; Weaver, SM",QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY,APR 3,10.1080/17470218.2014.961935,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17470218.2014.961935,
TBD,,Adria,Jackson,23,Neuronal population correlates of target selection and distractor filtering,"Frontal Eye Field (FEF) neurons discriminate between relevant and irrelevant visual stimuli and their response magnitude predicts conscious perception. How this is reflected in the spatial representation of a visual stimulus at the neuronal population level is unknown. We recorded neuronal population activity in the FEF while monkeys were performing a forced choice cued detection task with identical target and distractor stimuli. We quantified, using machine learning techniques, estimates of target and distractor location from FEF population multiunit activities. We found that the FEF population activity provides a precise single trial estimate of reported stimuli locations. Importantly, the closer this prefrontal population single trial estimate is to the veridical stimulus location, the higher the probability that the target or the distractor is reported as perceived. We show that stimulus perception is rescued by the estimate of attention allocation specifically when the latter is close enough to the actual stimulus location, thus indicating a partial independence between attention and perception. Overall, we thus show that how and what we perceive of our environment depends on the spatial precision with which this environment is coded by prefrontal neuronal populations.",Article,2020,"Astrand, E; Wardak, C; Ben Hamed, S",NEUROIMAGE,APR 1,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116517,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116517,
TBD,,Adria,Jackson,24,Selective visual attention to drive cognitive brain-machine interfaces: from concepts to neurofeedback and rehabilitation applications,"Brain machine interfaces (BMIs) using motor cortical activity to drive an external effector like a screen cursor or a robotic arm have seen enormous success and proven their great rehabilitation potential. An emerging parallel effort is now directed to BMIs controlled by endogenous cognitive activity, also called cognitive BMIs. While more challenging, this approach opens new dimensions to the rehabilitation of cognitive disorders. In the present work, we focus on BMIs driven by visuospatial attention signals and we provide a critical review of these studies in the light of the accumulated knowledge about the psychophysics, anatomy, and neurophysiology of visual spatial attention. Importantly, we provide a unique comparative overview of the several studies, ranging from non-invasive to invasive human and non-human primates studies, that decode attention-related information from ongoing neuronal activity. We discuss these studies in the light of the challenges attention-driven cognitive BMIs have to face. In a second part of the review, we discuss past and current attention-based neurofeedback studies, describing both the covert effects of neurofeedback onto neuronal activity and its overt behavioral effects. Importantly, we compare neurofeedback studies based on the amplitude of cortical activity to studies based on the enhancement of cortical information content. Last, we discuss several lines of future research and applications for attention-driven cognitive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), including the rehabilitation of cognitive deficits, restored communication in locked in patients, and open-field applications for enhanced cognition in normal subjects.

TBD,,Adria,Jackson,25,Object and space-based attentional selection in three-dimensional space,"It has been previously demonstrated that visual attention has an extent in depth (3D space) as well as an extent in the fronto-parallel plane (2D space). Numerous experiments have also demonstrated that attention can be allocated to objects, and that object-based attention can overcome some of the costs associated with moving attention about in 2D space. In real visual environments, objects often have an extent in depth. Four experiments were conducted to examine the nature of object-based attention in 3D space. The experiments demonstrated large object-based attention benefits, as well as costs for switching attention in depth. However, the costs associated with switching attention in depth were eliminated with objects that had an extent in depth. Experiments 2-4 examined the interaction of spatial attention in 3D space and object-based attention. Evidence was found for the spread of spatial attention to objects. However, contrary to other work (Lavie & Driver, 1996), neither non-predictive exogenous spatial cues (Experiment 2) nor predictive exogenous spatial cues (Experiments 3 and 4) were able to eliminate object-based attention, suggesting that object-based attention can remain intact despite the allocation of attention spatially.",Article,2001,"Atchley, P; Kramer, AF",VISUAL COGNITION,FEB,10.1080/13506280042000009,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13506280042000009,
TBD,,Adria,Jackson,26,Top-down control over biased competition during covert spatial orienting,"Larger benefits of spatial attention are observed when distractor interference is prevalent, supporting the view that spatial selection facilitates visual processing by suppressing distractor interference. The present work shows that cuing effects with identical visual displays can grow substantially as the probability of distractor interference increases. The probability of interference had no impact on spatial cuing effects in the absence of distractors, suggesting that the enlarged cuing effects were not caused by changes in signal enhancement or in the spatial distribution of attention. These findings suggest that attentional control settings determine more than where spatial attention is directed; top-down settings also influence how attention affects visual processing, with increased levels of distractor exclusion when distractor interference is likely.",Article,2003,"Awh, E; Matsukura, M; Serences, JT",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-HUMAN PERCEPTION AND PERFORMANCE,FEB,10.1037/0096-1523.29.1.52,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0096-1523.29.1.52,
TBD,,Adria,Jackson,27,Perceived speed differences explain apparent compression in slit viewing,"When a figure moves behind a stationary narrow slit, observers often report seeing the figure as an integrated whole, a phenomenon known as slit viewing or anorthoscopic perception. Interestingly, in slit viewing, the figure is perceived compressed along the axis of motion, e.g., a circle is perceived as an ellipse. Underestimation of the speed of the moving object was offered as an explanation. for this apparent compression. We measured perceived speed and compression in anorthoscopic perception and found results that are inconsistent with this hypothesis. We found evidence for an alternative hypothesis according to which apparent compression results from perceived speed differences between different parts of the figure, viz., the trailing parts are perceived to move faster than the leading parts. These differences in the perceived speeds of the trailing and the leading edges may be due to differences in the visibilities of the leading and trailing parts.

TBD,,Adria,Jackson,28,Time-course of spatial-attentional focusing in the case of high processing demand on the peripheral precue,"Subjects had to identify pairs of spatially overlapping or neighbouring letters exposed successively at various locations around the central fixation. The first letter (S1) in a pair acted both as a physical precue to indicate the S2 location and as a stimulus letter to be identified. The second letter (S2) in a pair acted only as a letter to be identified. The SOA was varied between 0 and 320 ms in different experiments. Comparison of the time-course functions of S2 identification in the conditions of (1) single pair presentation and (2) presentation of the letter pairs in the context of distracter letters that accompanied S2 in time, but occupied alternative spatial positions, revealed that S2 processing from the covert spatial-attentional focus was open to non-decreasing interference from the distracter letters up to 240 ms SOAs. An unexpected result consisted in equal level of S2 identification regardless of whether S1 had to be identified or not. This shows that if the peripheral precue has to be processed with higher processing demands at the identification level beyond simple location processing (which by itself is sufficient to fulfil the spatial orienting function), then the narrowing down or zooming-in of the attentional area in response to a physical precue can take place as effectively as in the case of a lesser processing demand on that precue. By comparing the relative time-course functions of S1 and S2 identification, it was found that S2 identification gained significant advantage over S1 identification at intermediate SOAs even if the intensity of S1 exceeded that of S2. The results of this investigation refer to the spontaneous, automatic nature of spatial attentional focusing that is evoked by spatially localised transient signals, but also to the possibility of interference between the targets and distracters in the working memory representation.",Article,1999,"Bachmann, T; Mäger, K; Sarv, M; Kahusk, N; Turner, J",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY,JUN,10.1080/713752312,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/713752312,

He argued from this that selectivity is determined solely by stimulus salience; the parallel stage of visual processing cannot provide top-down guidance to the attentive stage sufficient to permit completely selective use of task-relevant information. We argue that in the task used by Theeuwes, subjects may have adopted the strategy of searching for an odd form even though the specific target form was known. In Experiment 1, we replicated Theeuwes's findings. Search for a circle target among diamond nontargets was disrupted by the presence of a diamond nontarget that was uniquely colored. In two subsequent experiments, we discouraged the singleton detection strategy, forcing subjects to search for the target feature. There was no distracting effect of a color singleton in these experiments, even with displays physically identical to those of Experiment 1, demonstrating that top-down selectivity is indeed possible during visual search. We conclude that goal-directed selection of a specific known featural identity may override stimulus-driven capture by salient featural singletons.",Article,1994,"BACON, WF; EGETH, HE",PERCEPTION & PSYCHOPHYSICS,MAY,10.3758/BF03205306,http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/BF03205306,

Subjects were to report the first item he/she was able to identify in the series that did not include the target (the letter T) after he/she saw the target. In one condition, subjects knew in which list the target would appear; in another condition, they did not have this knowledge, having to attend to both positions in order to detect the target The zoom lens model predicts an interaction between this variable and the distance separating the two positions where the lists are presented.

Neglect and recovered patients were slower than controls on left-sided targets. To explore the time course of the allocation of attention across space, an analysis of responses as a function of the serial order of the trials was performed. While neglect patients' performance did not substantially change over time, recovered patients showed a stereotyped 'novelty effect', consisting of larger left/right RT differences at the beginning of the task than at the end of it. To explain this practice-related change, a trade-off is hypothesised between the process of learning the motor task and the mechanisms involved in recovery from neglect, such as the reorienting of attention toward the contralesional side following the initial ipsilesional orienting. A possible role is proposed for the prefrontal cortex as the crucial neural structure that mediates both processes.",Article,1997,"Bartolomeo, P",CORTEX,JUN,10.1016/S0010-9452(08)70008-X,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0010-9452(08)70008-X,
TBD,,Adria,Jackson,33,Orienting of attention in left unilateral neglect,"After right posterior brain damage, patients may ignore events occurring on their left, a condition known as unilateral neglect. Although deficits at different levels of impairment may be at work in different patients, the frequency and severity of attentional problems in neglect patients have been repeatedly underlined. Recent advances in the knowledge of the mechanisms of spatial attention in normals may help characterizing these deficits. The present review focuses on studies exploring several aspect of attentional processing in unilateral neglect, with particular reference to the dichotomy between 'exogenous', or stimulus-related, and 'endogenous', or strategy-driven, orienting of attention. A large amount of neuropsychological evidence suggests that a basic mechanism leading to left neglect behavior is an impaired exogenous orienting toward left-sided targets. In contrast, endogenous processes seem to be relatively preserved, if slowed, in left unilateral neglect. Other component deficits, such as a general slowing of the operations of spatial attention, might contribute to neglect behavior. These results are presented and discussed, and their implications for hemispheric specialization in attentional orienting and for the mechanisms of visual consciousness are explored.

TBD,,Adria,Jackson,34,Modulating the attentional bias in unilateral neglect:: the effects of the strategic set,"Left unilateral neglect is a neurological condition characterized by an impairment in orienting and responding to events occurring on the left side. To gain insight into the brain mechanisms of space processing and to provide theoretical foundations for patient rehabilitation, it is important to explore the attentional bias shown by neglect patients in the light of existing models of normal attentional orienting. Three experiments tested the hypothesis that attentional bias in neglect involves primarily exogenous, or stimulus-based, orienting of attention, with relatively preserved endogenous, or voluntary, orienting. Six patients with right hemisphere damage and left unilateral neglect and 18 age-matched participants without brain damage performed a cued reaction time (RT) task to targets which could appear in one of two lateral boxes. Cues consisted of a brief brightening of the contour of one of the boxes. The target followed the cue at 150, 550, or 1000 ms stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA). In experiment I, the cues were not informative about the future location of the target, and thus elicited a purely exogenous orienting of attention. Controls showed slowed RTs to the cued locations at SOAs > 150 ms, consistent with the notion of inhibition of return (IOR). Neglect patients had no evidence of IOR for right targets; they showed a disproportionate cost for left targets preceded by right (invalid) cues; this cost was maximal at the shortest SOA, consistent with the idea of a biased exogenous orienting in neglect. In experiment 2, 80% of the cues were valid (i.e., they correctly predicted the location of the impending target), thus inducing an initially exogenous, and later endogenous, attentional shift toward the cued box. Neglect patients showed again a cost for left invalidly cued targets, which this time persisted at SOAs > 150 ms, as if patients ' attention had been cued to the right side not only exogenously, but also endogenously, thus rendering more difficult an endogenous reorienting toward the left. In experiment 3, only 20% of the cues were valid, so that the best response strategy was to endogenously orient attention toward the box opposite to the cued one. Controls were able to take advantage of invalid cues to rapidly respond to targets. In this condition, neglect patients were able to nullify their spatial bias; they achieved their fastest RTs to left targets, which were in the range of their RTs to right targets. However, for neglect patients fast responses to left targets occurred only at 1000 ms SOA, while controls were able to redirect their attention to the uncued box already at 550 ms SOA. Altogether, these results suggest that endogenous orienting is relatively spared, if slowed, in unilateral neglect.",Article,2001,"Bartolomeo, P; Siéroff, E; Decaix, C; Chokron, S",EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH,APR,,,
TBD,,Adria,Jackson,35,Enhanced spatial focusing increases feature-based selection in unattended locations,"Attention is a multifaceted phenomenon, which operates on features (e.g., colour or motion) and over space. A fundamental question is whether the attentional selection of features is confined to the spatially-attended location or operates independently across the entire visual field (global feature-based attention, GFBA). Studies providing evidence for GFBA often employ feature probes presented at spatially unattended locations, which elicit enhanced brain responses when they match a currently-attended target feature. However, the validity of this interpretation relies on consistent spatial focusing onto the target. If the probe were to temporarily attract spatial attention, the reported effects could reflect transient spatial selection processes, rather than GFBA. Here, using magnetoencephalographic recordings (MEG) in humans, we manipulate the strength and consistency of spatial focusing to the target by increasing the target discrimination difficulty (Experiment 1), and by demarcating the upcoming target's location with a placeholder (Experiment 2), to see if GFBA effects are preserved. We observe that motivating stronger spatial focusing to the target did not diminish the effects of GFBA. Instead, aiding spatial pre-focusing with a placeholder enhanced the feature response at unattended locations. Our findings confirm that feature selection effects measured with spatially-unattended probes reflect a true location-independent neural bias.",Article,2018,"Bartsch, MV; Donohue, SE; Strumpf, H; Schoenfeld, MA; Hopf, JM",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,OCT 31,10.1038/s41598-018-34424-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-34424-5,

Here, we explore the possibility that choices can seem to occur before they are actually made.

Even when they believed that they had made their decision prior to this event, participants were significantly more likely than chance to report choosing the salient option when this option was made salient soon after the perceived time of choice. Thus, without participants' awareness, a seemingly later event influenced choices that were experienced as occurring at an earlier time. These findings suggest that, like certain low-level perceptual experiences, the experience of choice is susceptible to postdictive influence and that people may systematically overestimate the role that consciousness plays in their chosen behavior.",Article,2016,"Bear, A; Bloom, P",PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE,JUN,10.1177/0956797616641943,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0956797616641943,
TBD,,Adria,Jackson,37,The Role of Relational Information in Contingent Capture,"On the contingent capture account, top-down attentional control settings restrict involuntary attentional capture to items that match the features of the search target. Attention capture is involuntary, but contingent on goals and intentions. The observation that only target-similar items can capture attention has usually been taken to show that the content of the attentional control settings consists of specific feature values. In contrast, the present study demonstrates that the top-down target template can include information about the relationship between the target and nontarget features (e.g., redder, darker, larger). Several spatial cuing experiments show that a singleton cue that is less similar to the target but that shares the same relational property that distinguishes targets from nontargets can capture attention to the same extent as cues that are similar to the target. Moreover, less similar cues can even capture attention more than cues that are identical to the target when they are relationally better than identical cues.

The results showed that a motion singleton only captured attention on its first unannounced occurrence when the observers had not encountered moving items before in the experiment, whereas it failed to capture when observers were familiar with moving items. This indicates that motion can capture attention independently of top-down attentional control settings, but only when motion as a feature is unexpected and new. An additional experiment tested whether salient items can capture attention when all stimuli possess new and unexpected features, and novelty information cannot guide attention. The results showed that attention was shifted to the location of the salient item when all items were new and unexpected, reinforcing the view that salient items receive attentional priority.

TBD,,Adria,Jackson,39,Using auditory and visual stimuli to investigate the behavioral and neuronal consequences of reflexive covert orienting,"Reflexively orienting toward a peripheral cue can influence subsequent responses to a target, depending on when and where the cue and target appear relative to each other. At short delays between the cue and target [cue-target onset asynchrony (CTOA)], subjects are faster to respond when they appear at the same location, an effect referred to as reflexive attentional capture. At longer CTOAs, subjects are slower to respond when the two appear at the same location, an effect referred to as inhibition of return (IOR). Recent evidence suggests that these phenomena originate from sensory interactions between the cue- and target-related responses. The capture of attention originates from a strong target-related response, derived from the overlap of the cue- and target-related activities, whereas IOR corresponds to a weaker target-aligned response. If such interactions are responsible, then modifying their nature should impact the neuronal and behavioral outcome. Monkeys performed a cue- target saccade task featuring visual and auditory cues while neural activity was recorded from the superior colliculus (SC). Compared with visual stimuli, auditory responses are weaker and occur earlier, thereby decreasing the likelihood of interactions between these signals. Similar to previous studies, visual stimuli evoked reflexive attentional capture at a short CTOA (60 ms) and IOR at longer CTOAs (160 and 610 ms) with corresponding changes in the target-aligned activity in the SC. Auditory cues used in this study failed to elicit either a behavioral effect or modification of SC activity at any CTOA, supporting the hypothesis that reflexive orienting is mediated by sensory interactions between the cue and target stimuli.",Article,2004,"Bell, AH; Fecteau, JH; Munoz, DP",JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY,MAY,10.1152/jn.01080.2003,http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/jn.01080.2003,
TBD,,Adria,Jackson,40,The Role of Context in Volitional Control of Feature-Based Attention,"Visual selection can be biased toward nonspatial feature values such as color, but there is continued debate about whether this bias is subject to volitional control or whether it is an automatic bias toward recently seen target features (selection history). Although some studies have tried to separate these 2 sources of selection bias, mixed findings have not offered a clear resolution. The present work offers a possible explanation of conflicting findings by showing that the context in which a trial is presented can determine whether volitional control is observed. We used a cueing task that enabled independent assessments of the effects of color repetitions and current selection goals. When the target was presented among distractors with multiple colors (heterogeneous blocks), Experiment 1 revealed clear goal-driven selection effects, but these effects were eliminated when the target was a color singleton (pop-out blocks). When heterogeneous and pop-out displays were mixed within a block (Experiment 2), however, goal-driven selection was observed with both types of displays. In Experiment 3, this pattern was replicated using an encoding-limited task that included brief displays and an A' measure of performance. Thus, goal-driven selection of nonspatial features is potentiated in contexts where there is strong competition with distractors. Selection history has powerful effects, but we find clear evidence that observers can exert volitional control over feature-based attention.",Article,2016,"Belopolsky, AV; Awh, E",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-HUMAN PERCEPTION AND PERFORMANCE,FEB,10.1037/xhp0000135,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/xhp0000135,

In past studies of spatial attention, we and others have developed experimental paradigms that permit individuals to choose where to direct their attention on a trial-by-trial basis in the absence of instructive external cues - we term this willed attention. Here we investigate the electrophysiological correlates of willed attention by recording EEG activity when subjects decided to focus covert attention on one of two lateralized target locations versus when they decided to maintain attention at fixation. Independent of the direction of attention, decisions to attend, relative to decisions not to attend, resulted in significant increases in both frontal theta (4-7 Hz) power and central alpha (8-13 Hz) power. We found that focusing spatial attention, as indexed by occipital alpha lateralization was predicted across subjects by the decision-related alpha increases over central scalp regions, but not changes in frontal theta power.

In Experiment 1, 24 research participants performing a primary simulated driving task were required to apply the brake pedal as quickly as possible following the activation of a red light somewhere in their field of vision. The red lights were displayed in one of two ways, (a) with 20 Hz luminance flicker and (b) continuous (no flicker), and presented at three eccentricities, 10 degrees, 45 degrees and 80 degrees. Results showed that the light with 20 Hz flicker was more attention-capturing than the continuous light, but that the effect of 20 Hz flicker on reaction time was not influenced by eccentricity of presentation. The second experiment was identical to the first except that the primary simulated driving task was considerably more attention demanding. Under this higher workload, the light with 20 Hz flicker again proved to be more attention-capturing than the continuous light, and to a greater extent than in Experiment 1. In Experiment 2, there also appeared to be tendency for the light with 20 Hz flicker to be more effective at greater eccentricities.

TBD,,Adria,Jackson,44,Peripheral non-informative cues do induce early facilitation of target detection,"One of the classic findings in the literature of visual orienting of attention is that performance is facilitated by a valid cue even when it is non-informative. This facilitation is then followed by a period of inhibition of the cued area, known as inhibition of return. Researchers have suggested that the early facilitation is the result of orienting of attention. However, because cues are commonly presented for 100-200 msec, the facilitation usually overlaps cue presentation. Thus, it is possible that facilitation could be attributed to sensory summation rather than to attention. Hence, facilitation may not occur when cue and target do not overlap. Three experiments were designed to clarify this issue. We found early facilitation followed by inhibition. The facilitation was the same whether the cue was present or not. Moreover, facilitation was not affected by cue duration or by target duration. These results reaffirm the idea that a non-informative peripheral cue can activate the exogenous orienting system, to produce both facilitation and inhibition of detection.",Article,1999,"Berger, A; Dori, H; Henik, A",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY,MAR,10.1080/713752304,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/713752304,

We demonstrate an asymmetry between temporal and nasal hemifields in the strategic modulation of IOR by endogenously controlled attention. Exogenous and endogenous precues were manipulated independently on each trial such that precues to initiate endogenous spatial orienting were presented after IOR had been activated by exogenous visual signals. Both types of precues manifested their characteristic effects on reaction time (RT) to detect subsequent targets: facilitation by endogenous precues, and IOR by exogenous precues. Under monocular viewing, an asymmetric interaction between these two mechanisms was observed. While endogenous allocation of attention to the nasal hemifield reduced IOR, no endogenous modulation of IOR was present in the temporal hemifield where the effects of the two types of precues were independent.

Search displays were preceded by spatial cues. Participants responded to target objects at cued/relevant locations, and ignored them when they appeared on the uncued/irrelevant side. In four experiments, electrophysiological markers of attentional selection and distractor suppression (N2pc and P-D components) were measured for relevant and irrelevant target-matching objects. During singleton search, N2pc components were triggered by relevant target singletons, but were entirely absent for singletons on the irrelevant side, demonstrating effective spatial filtering. Critically, similar results were found for feature-based search. N2pcs to irrelevant target-colour objects were either absent or strongly attenuated (when these objects were salient), indicating that the feature-based guidance of visual search can be restricted to relevant locations. The presence of P-D components to salient objects on the irrelevant side during feature-based and singleton search suggests that spatial filtering involves active distractor suppression. These results challenge the assumption that feature-based attentional guidance is always spatially global. They suggest instead that when advance information about target locations becomes available, effective spatial filtering processes are activated transiently not only in singleton search, but also during search for feature-defined targets.",Article,2020,"Berggren, N; Eimer, M",ATTENTION PERCEPTION & PSYCHOPHYSICS,JUL,10.3758/s13414-020-01977-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/s13414-020-01977-5,
TBD,,Adria,Jackson,48,Feature-guided attentional capture cannot be prevented by spatial filtering,"Feature-based control processes guide attention towards objects with target features in visual search. While these processes are assumed to operate globally across the entire visual field, it remains controversial whether target-matching objects at task-irrelevant locations can be excluded from attentional selection, especially when spatial attention is already narrowly focused elsewhere. We investigated whether probe stimuli at irrelevant lateral locations capture attention when they precede search displays where targets are defined either by a specific feature (colour or orientation) or by a colour/orientation conjunction by measuring N2pc components (an electrophysiological marker of attentional target selection) to these probes. Reliable N2pcs were triggered by probes not only in the feature search tasks but also when participants searched for feature conjunctions, in spite of the fact that conjunction search requires focal spatial attention. Analogous N2pc results were found in the absence of any spatial uncertainty about the location of conjunctively defined targets, which always appeared at fixation. These results show that rapid attentional capture by objects with target-matching features cannot be prevented by top-down spatial filtering mechanisms, and confirm that feature-based attentional guidance processes operate in a spatially global fashion.",Article,2018,"Berggren, N; Eimer, M",BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY,APR,10.1016/j.biopsycho.2018.02.007,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsycho.2018.02.007,

This cue-induced inhibition is called inhibition of return or ipsilateral inhibition. We measured detection RT to simple Light targets at extrafoveal locations that could be designated for covert orienting by local or distant cues. We found that cue-induced inhibition co-occurred in an additive fashion with the direct effects of covert orienting, i.e., it detracted from facilitation at attended locations and increased the disadvantage for unattended locations. Thus, cue-induced inhibition cannot be suppressed by a volitional covert orienting to the cued location; the co-occurrence of different facilitatory and inhibitory effects confirms the simultaneous operation of multiple independent attentional mechanisms during covert orienting.",Article,2000,"Berlucchi, G; Chelazzi, L; Tassinari, G",JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE,JUL,10.1162/089892900562408,http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/089892900562408,
TBD,,Adria,Jackson,50,The Limits of Visual Working Memory in Children: Exploring Prioritization and Recency Effects With Sequential Presentation,"Recent research has demonstrated that, when instructed to prioritize a serial position in visual working memory (WM), adults are able to boost performance for this selected item, at a cost to nonprioritized items (e.g., Hu, Hitch, Baddeley, Zhang, & Allen, 2014). While executive control appears to play an important role in this ability, the increased likelihood of recalling the most recently presented item (i.e., the recency effect) is relatively automatic, possibly driven by perceptual mechanisms. In 3 Experiments 7 to 10 year-old's ability to prioritize items in WM was investigated using a sequential visual task (total N = 208). The relationship between individual differences in WM and performance on the experimental task was also explored. Participants were unable to prioritize the first (Experiments 1 and 2) or final (Experiment 3) item in a 3-item sequence, while large recency effects for the final item were consistently observed across all experiments. The absence of a priority boost across 3 experiments indicates that children may not have the necessary executive resources to prioritize an item within a visual sequence, when directed to do so. In contrast, the consistent recency boosts for the final item indicate that children show automatic memory benefits for the most recently encountered stimulus. Finally, for the baseline condition in which children were instructed to remember all 3 items equally, additional WM measures predicted performance at the first and second but not the third serial position, further supporting the proposed automaticity of the recency effect in visual WM.",Article,2018,"Berry, EDJ; Waterman, AH; Baddeley, AD; Hitch, GJ; Allen, RJ",DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY,FEB,10.1037/dev0000427,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0000427,
TBD,,Adria,Jackson,51,The ventriloquist effect does not depend on the direction of deliberate visual attention,"It is well known that discrepancies in the location of synchronized auditory and visual events can lead to mislocalizations of the auditory source, so-called ventriloquism. In two experiments, we tested whether such cross-modal influences on auditory localization depend on deliberate visual attention to the biasing visual event. In Experiment 1, subjects pointed to the apparent source of sounds in the presence or absence of a synchronous peripheral flash. They also monitored for target visual events, either at the location of the peripheral flash or in a central location. Auditory localization was attracted toward the synchronous peripheral flash, but this was unaffected by where deliberate visual attention was directed in the monitoring task. In Experiment 2, bilateral flashes were presented in synchrony with each sound, to provide competing visual attractors. When these visual events were equally salient on the two sides, auditory localization was unaffected by which side subjects monitored for visual targets: When one flash was larger than the other, auditory localization was slightly but reliably attracted toward it, but again regardless of where visual monitoring was required. We conclude that ventriloquism largely reflects automatic sensory interactions, with little or no role for deliberate spatial attention.",Article,2000,"Bertelson, P; Vroomen, J; de Gelder, B; Driver, J",PERCEPTION & PSYCHOPHYSICS,FEB,10.3758/BF03205552,http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/BF03205552,
TBD,,Adria,Jackson,52,Attentional capture: Role of top-down focused spatial attention and the need to search among multiple locations,"Top-down focused spatial attention can counteract bottom-up attentional capture of an irrelevant but salient distractor outside the attentional focus. The present behavioural study differentiates two alternative concepts accounting for the absence of attentional capture under top-down focused attention. In particular, top-down focused attention may counteract attentional capture by altering salience coding outside the focus of attention. Alternatively, spatially focusing on a pre-defined region of potential target locations may omit the need to search among multiple salience signals, thereby eliminating the tendency of unattended stimuli to compete for attentional selection and, hence, to capture attention. Spatial cues explicitly indicating a variable number of potential target locations preceded the additional singleton paradigm to gradually manipulate the need to search for a target (i.e., to select a target from an array of distractors) and to determine its effects on attentional capture. Attentional capture occurred only when a salient distractor was located at potential target locations and never occurred when located outside the attended spotlight. This finding was independent of the parametrical variations related to the need to search for the target, which did not modulate attentional capture either. Accordingly, our data suggest that the presence or absence of salience-based distraction of unattended stimuli is not per se affected by the need to select a target from multiple salience signals.",Article,2017,"Bertleff, S; Fink, GR; Weidner, R",VISUAL COGNITION,,10.1080/13506285.2017.1338813,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13506285.2017.1338813,

Three experiments evaluated the effectiveness of the technique and appropriate timing parameters and alternatives for presentation onset. Our experiments indicated that an 80 ms no-onset presentation allows participants to interpret information directed to them with over 90% accuracy, but their ability to interpret simultaneously presented information intended for others will be close to random chance.

TBD,,Adria,Jackson,54,Automatic object-based spatial selection depends on the distribution of sustained attention,"Several space-based and object-based attention studies suggest these selection mechanisms may be voluntarily deployed, depending on task parameters and the attentional scope of the observer. Here, we sought to elucidate factors related to involuntary deployment of object-mediated space-based attention through two experiments. Experiment 1 used a modified flanker task where a target and nearby distractor were presented within the same or different object frames, such that an object-based attentional spread should be detrimental to performance. Results showed the presence of a flanker effect with no significant difference in magnitude between grouping conditions, indicating participants may have uniformly used a diffused attentional spotlight regardless of object segmentation. In a second experiment, we manipulated the extent of the observer's sustained attentional scope via an inducer task to determine whether object-based selection depends on the initial spotlight size. The results revealed object-based effects solely when attention narrowly encompassed the target, but not when it was widened to include the distracting flanker. This suggests the deployment of object-based attention may occur when spatial attention is initially focused narrowly. Because selecting the whole object frame directly interfered with task goals, we conclude that object-based attention may not always fully conform to relevant task goals or operate in a goal-oriented manner. We discuss these results in the context of existing literature while proposing a reconciliation of previously inconsistent findings of object-based selection.",Article,2021,"Bidiwala, ES; Scolari, M",ATTENTION PERCEPTION & PSYCHOPHYSICS,OCT,10.3758/s13414-021-02325-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/s13414-021-02325-x,

For each trial, a spoken word (left/right) was presented monaurally at the onset of the visual image. Spatially invalid auditory cues (i.e., in the ear contralateral to the correct passing,option [as judged by three netball experts]), reduced performance accuracy relative to valid ones. Semantically invalid cues (e.g., a call of left when the target was right-located), increased response times relative to valid ones.

In Experiment 2, 42 skilled netballers completed three tasks, in randomised order: a visual detection task, a visual discrimination task and a netball decision-making task - all in the presence of spoken cues. Our data showed that spoken auditory cues affected not only target detection, but also performance on more complex decision-making tasks: cues that were either spatially or semantically invalid slowed target detection time; spatially invalid cues impaired discrimination task accuracy; and cues that were either spatially or semantically valid improved accuracy and speeded decision-making time in the netball task.

Accounts taking a strong automaticity line suggest that the amygdala's response to threat is both involuntary and independent of attentional resources. Building on these accounts, prominent models have suggested that anxiety modulates the output of an amygdala-based preattentive threat evaluation system. Here, we argue for a modification of these models. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected while volunteers performed a letter search task of high or low perceptual load superimposed on fearful or neutral face distractors. Neither high- nor low-anxious volunteers showed an increased amygdala response to threat distractors under high perceptual load, contrary to a strong automaticity account of amygdala function. Under low perceptual load, elevated state anxiety was associated with a heightened response to threat distractors in the amygdala and superior temporal sulcus, whereas individuals high in trait anxiety showed a reduced prefrontal response to these stimuli, consistent with weakened recruitment of control mechanisms used to prevent the further processing of salient distractors. These findings suggest that anxiety modulates processing subsequent to competition for perceptual processing resources, with state and trait anxiety having distinguishable influences upon the neural mechanisms underlying threat evaluation and top-down control.",Article,2007,"Bishop, SJ; Jenkins, R; Lawrence, AD",CEREBRAL CORTEX,JUL,10.1093/cercor/bhl070,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhl070,

Phase 3 was similar in design but provided occasional choice trials on which two targets appeared. The birds were more likely to respond to the more frequent target on such trials only if it was also the most discriminable.

Larger target set sizes enhanced sequential, but not visual, priming. Sequential priming did not depend on display size over the range of relatively large displays used.

TBD,,Adria,Jackson,60,Working memory load disrupts gaze-cued orienting of attention,"A large body of work has shown that a perceived gaze shift produces a shift in a viewer's spatial attention in the direction of the seen gaze. A controversial issue surrounds the extent to which this gaze-cued orienting effect is stimulus-driven, or is under a degree of top-down control. In two experiments we show that the gaze-cued orienting effect is disrupted by a concurrent task that has been shown to place high demands on executive resources: random number generation (RNG). In Experiment 1 participants were faster to locate targets that appeared in gaze-cued locations relative to targets that appeared in locations opposite to those indicated by the gaze shifts, while simultaneously and continuously reciting aloud the digits 1-9 in order; however, this gaze-cueing effect was eliminated when participants continuously recited the same digits in a random order. RNG was also found to interfere with gaze-cued orienting in Experiment 2 where participants performed a speeded letter identification response. Together, these data suggest that gaze-cued orienting is actually under top-down control. We argue that top-down signals sustain a goal to shift attention in response to gazes, such that orienting ordinarily occurs when they are perceived; however, the goal cannot always be maintained when concurrent, multiple, competing goals are simultaneously active in working memory.",Article,2015,"Bobak, AK; Langton, SRH",FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,AUG 24,10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01258,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01258,
TBD,,Adria,Jackson,61,Pinning down response inhibition in the brain - Conjunction analyses of the Stop-signal task,"Successful behavior requires a finely-tuned interplay of initiating and inhibiting motor programs to react effectively to constantly changing environmental demands. One particularly useful paradigm for investigating inhibitory motor control is the Stop-signal task, where already-initiated responses to Go-stimuli are to be inhibited upon the rapid subsequent presentation of a Stop-stimulus (yielding successful and unsuccessful Stop-trials). Despite the extensive use of this paradigm in functional neuroimaging, there is no consensus on which functional comparison to use to characterize response-inhibition-related brain activity. Here, we utilize conjunction analyses of successful and unsuccessful Stop-trials that are each contrasted against a reference condition. This conjunction approach identifies processes common to both Stop-trial types while excluding processes specific to either, thereby capitalizing on the presence of some response-inhibition-related activity in both conditions. Using this approach on fMRI data from human subjects, we identify a network of brain structures that was linked to both types of Stop-trials, including lateral-inferior frontal and medial frontal cortical areas and the caudate nucleus. In addition, comparisons with a reference condition matched for visual stimulation identified additional activity in the right inferior parietal cortex that may play a role in enhancing the processing of the Stop-stimuli. Finally, differences in stopping efficacy across subjects were associated with variations in activity in the left anterior insula. However, this region was also associated with general task accuracy (which furthermore correlated directly with stopping efficacy), suggesting that it might actually reflect a more general mechanism of performance control that supports response inhibition in a relatively nonspecific way.

In a close replication requiring the detection of luminance increments instead of line-length differences, subjects were unable to follow the instructions and to allocate attention differentially, thus supporting the claim that light detection is fundamentally different from shape discrimination. In a subsequent experiment, we tested and rejected the possibility that luminance perception was not open to modulation by attention due to its physical nature. Replacing brightness detection by brightness identification allowed voluntary control on the quality of processing to be evidenced.

To determine whether both onsets and offsets have the ability to influence eye movements, a series of experiments was conducted in which participants had to make goal-directed eye movements to a color singleton target in the presence of an irrelevant onset/offset. In accord with previous research, onsets had the ability to capture the eyes. The offset of an object demonstrated little or no ability to interrupt goal-directed eye movements to the target. Two experiments in which the effects of onsets and offsets on covert attention were examined suggest that offsets do not capture the eyes, because they have a lesser ability to capture covert attention than do onsets. A number of other studies that have shown strong effects of offsets on attention have used offsets that were uncorrelated with target position (i.e., nonpredictive), whereas we used onsets and offsets that never served as targets (i.e., antipredictive).

We examined the effects of donepezil, a cholinesterase inhibitor, on stimulus-driven attentional capture. Reflexive attention shifts to a distractor are usually elicited by abrupt peripheral changes. This bottom-up shift of attention to a salient item is thought to be the result of relatively inflexible hardwired mechanisms. Thirty young male participants were randomly allocated to one of two groups: placebo first/donepezil second session or the opposite. They were asked to locate a target appearing above and below fixation whilst a peripheral distractor moved abruptly (motion-jitter attentional capture condition) or not (baseline condition). A classical attentional capture effect was observed under placebo: moving distractors interfered with the task in slowing down response times as compared to the baseline condition with fixed distractors. Increased interference from moving distractors was found under donepezil. We suggest that attentional capture in our paradigm likely involved low level mechanisms such as automatic reflexive orienting. Peripheral motion-jitter elicited a rapid reflexive orienting response initiated by a cholinergic signal from the brainstem pedunculo-pontine nucleus that activates nicotinic receptors in the superior colliculus.

Precueing spatial attention has been shown to improve perceptual performance on a number of visual tasks. However, the effects of spatial attention on visual crowding, defined as the reduction in the ability to identify target objects in clutter, are far less clear. In this study, we used an anticueing paradigm to separately measure the effects of involuntary and voluntary spatial attention on a crowding task. Each trial began with a brief peripheral cue that predicted that the crowded target would appear on the opposite side of the screen 80% of the time and on the same side of the screen 20% of the time. Subjects performed an orientation discrimination task on a target Gabor patch that was flanked by other similar Gabor patches with independent random orientations. For trials with a short stimulus onset asynchrony between cue and target, involuntary capture of attention led to faster response times and smaller critical spacing when the target appeared on the cue side. For trials with a long stimulus onset asynchrony, voluntary allocation of attention led to faster reaction times but no significant effect on critical spacing when the target appeared on the opposite side to the cue.

Researchers studying human multitasking have traditionally focused on the cognitive control mechanisms that allow for such stable and flexible task execution, but there has been a recent interest in how cognitive control mechanisms drive the decision of task selection. The present research operationalizes a foraging analogy to investigate what factors drive the decision to either exploit task repetitions or explore task switches. A novel paradigm-reward-based voluntary task switching-ascribes point values to tasks where the overall goal is to accumulate points as quickly as possible. The reward structure generally rewards switching tasks, thereby juxtaposing the motivation to gain increased reward (by exploring task switches) against the motivation to perform quickly (by exploiting task repetitions). Results suggest that people are highly sensitive to changes in both reward and effort demands when making task selections, and that the task selection process is efficient and flexible. We argue that a cost-benefit mechanism might underlie decisions in multitasking contexts, whereby people compute task selections based on both the reward available for selecting a task and the effort necessary to execute a task.",Article,2018,"Braun, DA; Arrington, CM",PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH-PSYCHOLOGISCHE FORSCHUNG,JAN,10.1007/s00426-017-0919-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00426-017-0919-x,

Auditory inputs enter cortex with its own set of unique qualities, and leads to use in oral communication, speech, music, and the understanding of emotional and intentional states of others, all of which are central to the human experience. To better understand how the auditory system develops, recovers after injury, and how it may have transitioned in its functions over the course of hominin evolution, advances are needed in models of how the human brain is organized to process real-world natural sounds and auditory objects. This review presents a simple fundamental neurobiological model of hearing perception at a category level that incorporates principles of bottom-up signal processing together with top-down constraints of grounded cognition theories of knowledge representation. Though mostly derived from human neuroimaging literature, this theoretical framework highlights rudimentary principles of real-world sound processing that may apply to most if not all mammalian species with hearing and acoustic communication abilities. The model encompasses three basic categories of sound-source: (1) action sounds (non-vocalizations) produced by 'living things', with human (conspecific) and non-human animal sources representing two subcategories; (2) action sounds produced by 'non-living things', including environmental sources and human-made machinery; and (3) vocalizations (giving things'), with human versus non-human animals as two subcategories therein. The model is presented in the context of cognitive architectures relating to multisensory, sensory-motor, and spoken language organizations. The models' predictive values are further discussed in the context of anthropological theories of oral communication evolution and the neurodevelopment of spoken language proto-networks in infants/toddlers.

However, the extent to which this effect is independent from intentional processes is not clear. In two EEG experiments, we isolated the unintentional component of this effect from high-level, intentional factors. Visual targets were presented either in-phase or out-of-phase with regularly flickering colored stimuli. In different blocks, the rhythm could be predictive (i.e., high probability for in-phase target) or not, and the color could be predictive (i.e., validly cue the interval to the target) or not. Exposure to nonpredictive rhythms resulted in faster responses for in-phase targets, even when the color predicted specific out-of-phase target times. Also, the contingent negative variation, an EEG component reflecting temporal anticipation, followed the interval of the nonpredictive rhythm and not that of the predictive color. Thus, rhythmic stimulation unintentionally induced expectations, even when this was detrimental. Intentional usage of predictive rhythms to form expectations resulted in a stronger behavioral effect, and only predictive cues modulated the latency of the target-evoked P3, presumably reflecting stimulus evaluation. These findings establish the existence of unintentional temporal expectations in rhythmic contexts, dissociate them from intentional expectations, and highlight the need to distinguish between the source of expectation (exogenous-endogenous) and the level of voluntary control involved in it (unintentional-intentional).",Article,2014,"Breska, A; Deouell, LY",JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE,JUL,10.1162/jocn_a_00564,http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/jocn_a_00564,
TBD,,Adria,Jackson,70,Visual attentional capture predicts belief in a meaningful world,"Here we show that the automatic, involuntary process of attentional capture is predictive of beliefs that are typically considered as much more complex and higher-level. Whereas some beliefs are well supported by evidence, others, such as the belief that coincidences occur for a reason, are not. We argue that the tendency to assign meaning to coincidences is a byproduct of an adaptive system that creates and maintains cognitive schemata, and automatically directs attention to violations of a currently active schema. Earlier studies have shown that, within subjects, attentional capture increases with schema strength. Yet, between-subjects effects could exist too: whereas each of us has schemata of various strengths, most likely different individuals are differently inclined to maintain strong or weak ones. Since schemata can be interpreted as beliefs, we predict more attentional capture for subjects with stronger beliefs than for subjects with weaker ones. We measured visual attentional capture in a reaction time experiment, and correlated it with scores on questionnaires about religious and other beliefs and about meaningfulness and surprisingness of coincidences. We found that visual attentional capture predicts a belief in meaningfulness of coincidences, and that this belief mediates a relationship between visual attentional capture and religiosity. Remarkably, strong believers were more disturbed by schema violations than weak believers, and yet appeared less aware of the disrupting events. We conclude that (a) religious people have a stronger belief in meaningfulness of coincidences, indicative of a more general tendency to maintain strong schemata, and that (b) this belief leads them to suppress, ignore, or forget information that has demonstrably captured their attention, but happens to be inconsistent with their schemata.

Prinzmetal, D. E. Presti, & M. I. Posner, 1986; A. Treisman, 1985). However 1 study using this procedure (K. Briand & R. M. Klein, 1987) reported that this pattern is obtained only when spatial attention is oriented exogenously (reflexively), not when it is oriented endogenously (voluntarily). Five experiments attempted to replicate and extend this finding of Briand and Klein while including procedures that addressed some of the criticisms directed at these aforementioned studies by Y. Tsal (1989a, 1989b). The data indicate that the findings reported by Briand and Klein were reliable and robust; spatial orienting effects were greater when the task required detection of conjunctions as opposed to features, but only when attention was directed by exogenous cues.

TBD,,Adria,Jackson,72,Purely endogenous capture of attention by task-defining features proceeds independently from spatial attention,"Attention can be focused voluntarily and effectively on spatial locations in order to enhance the processing of task-relevant events. However, work on 'attentional capture' has demonstrated that spatial biases can be temporarily reset by transient and salient stimuli, especially if they share defining characteristics with the targets of a task goal. In the current study, we investigated whether the appearance of stimuli containing task-defining features at an unattended location was sufficient to capture attention, even when these were not perceptually salient. We used event-related-potential (ERP) markers to test whether the selection of task-defining features was modulated by top-down spatial attention, and to test whether the appearance of 'unattended targets' transiently disrupted the spatial bias. Surprisingly, the results revealed that ERP markers of selection of task-defining features were equivalent for stimuli appearing at spatially attended and unattended locations. In addition, the presentation of task-defining stimuli at the spatially unattended location induced a short-lived redistribution of the pre-established spatial attention bias toward the 'capture' side. These findings show that task-defining features of a stimulus are automatically processed independently from spatial attention, and suggest the co-existence of multiple sources of top-down biasing signals, which might in part sustain the capture mechanism.

TBD,,Adria,Jackson,73,"Additive effects of emotional, endogenous, and exogenous attention: Behavioral and electrophysiological evidence","Selective attention is not a unitary construct, but is composed of several processes. Attention selection may be guided by low-level stimulus properties, by the emotional value of the stimulus, or more voluntarily by the goals and plans of the observer. Whether these three systems operate independently during attention selection or not remains a debated question. We report results from two studies investigating the extent to which these different attention mechanisms may interact with one another. Using a standard dot probe paradigm wherein effects of exogenous, emotional, and endogenous attention were orthogonally manipulated, we found attentional facilitation effects for each component, indicated by faster decision times for validly, as opposed to invalidly cued targets. Moreover, results confirmed that these three attentional effects added up in a linear fashion. Complementing ERP results allowed us to disentangle the respective contributions of the two reflexive, bottom-up attention processes (exogenous vs. emotional) by showing non-overlapping temporal loci for attentional effects related either to low-level physical properties or the emotional content of the stimulus. These findings suggest that multiple separate attention mechanisms can operate simultaneously to yield a rapid and efficient visual processing of various classes of potentially relevant stimuli.

The authors compared attention capture to 3 alternatives involving parallel rather than serial processing: In the lexicon, activation is divided among multiple words; postlexically, multiple words race for access to response processes; or prelexically, feature processing is degraded by multiple patterns whether or not they are words. Results support the latter. Multiple patterns are processed in parallel.

TBD,,Adria,Jackson,77,Towards a conceptual framework of research on social signal processing,"Social Signal Processing (SSP) as an emerging research area can draw on material from many disciplines, but it needs effective ways to organise the material. We propose a framework that integrates concepts, drawn primarily from psychology, but with input from other disciplines, in a way that indicates how they relate to SSP. We identify seven core constructs: state; indicators that convey info about it; process by which indicators are generated; types of inference involved in identifying states from indicators; perceptual issues, including recovery of indicators from flux of activity and accuracy of impressions about the state; the role of macro-context; and the different levels at which analysis may be couched (the individual, the dyad, the group, the organisation). These may or may not be reflected in the structure of an SSP system, but the natural subtlety and context-sensitivity of human communication makes it important that people designing systems should consider how they relate to its task, and decide how best to take account of them. The analysis works from simple models which consider only states and indicators to models which embrace all seven constructs. At each stage it points to the literatures which discuss the relevant issues. It is fully acknowledged that attempting such a synthesis raises many problems (not least of terminology), and that alternative frameworks deal at least as well with subsets of the issues.

TBD,,Adria,Jackson,78,Appetitive and aversive outcome associations modulate exogenous cueing,"In two experiments, we utilized an exogenous cueing task in which different-colored abrupt-onset cues were associated with an appetitive (gain of 10 cents), aversive (loss of 5 cents), or neutral (no gain or loss) outcome. Reward delivery did not depend on performance, but instead the specific exogenous cues were always followed by their corresponding outcome in a classical-conditioning-like manner. Compared to neutral cues and independent of cue-target delay, the results of Experiment 1 showed that appetitive cues strengthened attentional capture, whereas aversive cues reduced attentional capture. The data revealed that both appetitive and aversive cues initially facilitated responding at the validly cued location. At the long cue-target delays, however, this facilitation effect at the validly cued location remained present for gain-associated cues while it reversed for loss-associated cues. The results of Experiment 2 confirmed these findings by showing that both neutral and aversive cues initially facilitated responding at the cued location and that, at long cue-target delays, aversive cues elicited stronger reorienting away from the cued location as compared to neutral cues. Together these findings indicate that all abrupt-onset cues initially capture attention independent of their outcome association. Yet, if time passes, attention remains lingering at the location of gain-associated cues, whereas attention is released and reoriented away from the location of loss-associated cues. Altogether, we show that associating the color of an abrupt-onset cue with an appetitive or aversive outcome can modulate attentional deployment following exogenous cueing.",Article,2016,"Bucker, B; Theeuwes, J",ATTENTION PERCEPTION & PSYCHOPHYSICS,OCT,10.3758/s13414-016-1107-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/s13414-016-1107-6,

A central challenge for action theory is to explain how individuals guide. This challenge is an instance of the more general problem of how to accommodate individuals and their actions in the natural world, as explained by natural science. Two dominant traditions-primitivism and the causal theory-fail to address the challenge in a satisfying way. Causal theorists appeal to causation by an intention, through a feedback mechanism, in explaining guidance. Primitivists postulate primitive agential capacities in their explanations. The latter neglect to explain how primitive capacities integrate with findings from natural science. The former do not explain why some feedback mechanism's activity amounts to the agent's guidance. In this paper I argue that both traditions should acknowledge a capacity to guide, as actually constituted by the executive system.

We investigated three eye movement instructions (spontaneous, saccade, and fixation) while participants performed goal-directed (i.e., reaching) or symbolic (i.e., finger-lift) responses. Initially, no oculomotor constraints were imposed, and a Simon effect was present for both response types. Next, eye movements were constrained. Participants had to either make a saccade toward the stimulus or maintain gaze fixed in the screen centre. While a congruency effect was always observed in reaching responses, it disappeared in finger-lift responses. We suggest that the redirection of saccades from the stimulus to the correct response location in noncorresponding trials contributes to the Simon effect. Because of eye-hand coupling, this occurred in a mandatory manner with reaching responses but not with finger-lift responses.

Gibson and Kelsey (1998) extended Folk et al.'s (1992) hypothesis by demonstrating that features associated with the appearance of the target display also mediate capture. Although similar to Folk et al. (1992), Gibson and Kelsey's displaywide contingent orienting hypothesis makes it difficult to demonstrate stimulus-driven capture, because an observer must always use some perceptible feature as a signal of the target display's appearance; hence, such features could always be mediating capture. The present article reviews and applies the logic of Gibson and Kelsey's and Folk et al.'s (1992) hypotheses to experiments from the attentional capture literature, and assesses whether previously reported capture effects were mediated by top-down attentional. control.

Recent studies have also demonstrated that precuing a location to ignore reduces distraction by items in that location; however, precuing a feature (colour) to ignore increases distractor interference, at least before a template for rejection is established. Thus, locations, not features, can be selectively ignored. The present study used a spatial cuing task to examine whether featurally-relevant items are selected when they appear in ignored locations. The results revealed contingent attentional capture by target-relevant cues (red cue when searching for red targets, but not for onset targets), even when the cue appeared in a location that was ignored. Importantly, this was equivalent to contingent capture elicited by cues in non-ignored locations. However, when observers were precued to the target location, contingent capture was largely eliminated.

TBD,,Jackson,Bailey,857,Conditional control in visual selection,"Attention and eye movements provide a window into the selective processing of visual information. Evidence suggests that selection is influenced by various factors and is not always under the strategic control of the observer. The aims of this tutorial review are to give a brief introduction to eye movements and attention and to outline the conditions that help determine control. Evidence suggests that the ability to establish control depends on the complexity of the display as well as the point in time at which selection occurs. Stimulus-driven selection is more probable in simple displays than in complex natural scenes, but it critically depends on the timing of the response: Salience determines selection only when responses are triggered quickly following display presentation, and plays no role in longer-latency responses. The time course of selection is also important for the relationship between attention and eye movements. Specifically, attention and eye movements appear to act independently when oculomotor selection is quick, whereas attentional processes are able to influence oculomotor control when saccades are triggered only later in time. This relationship may also be modulated by whether the eye movement is controlled in a voluntary or an involuntary manner. To conclude, we present evidence that shows that visual control is limited in flexibility and that the mechanisms of selection are constrained by context and time. The outcome of visual selection changes with the situational context, and knowing the constraints of control is necessary to understanding when and how visual selection is truly controlled by the observer.",Review,2017,"van Zoest, W; Van der Stigchel, S; Donk, M",ATTENTION PERCEPTION & PSYCHOPHYSICS,AUG,10.3758/s13414-017-1352-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/s13414-017-1352-3,

They can be clinically detected by means of conventional bedside tests such as target cancellation, line bisection and the visual extinction test. Until recently, lesion mapping studies and functional imaging of the intact brain did not agree very well on exactly which parietal areas play a key role in selective attention: the inferior parietal lobule or the intraparietal sulcus. Recently, the use of a contrastive approach in patients akin to that commonly used in functional imaging studies in healthy volunteers together with voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping have allowed to bring the patient lesion mapping much closer to the functional imaging results obtained in healthy controls. In this review we focus on converging evidence obtained from patient lesion studies and from fMRI studies in the intact brain in humans. This has yielded novel insights into the functional segregation between the middle third of the intraparietal sulcus, the superior parietal lobule and the temporoparietal junction in the intact brain and also enhanced our understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying deficits arising in patients.

TBD,,Jackson,Bailey,859,Functional specificity of superior parietal mediation of spatial shifting,"Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we determined how brain activity changes when an attended target shifts its location. In the main experiment, a white square could appear at 10 possible eccentricities along the horizontal meridian. It remained on the screen for a variable period of time and then changed location. At any time the stimulus could dim briefly. Subjects had to press a button when the stimulus dimmed. In order to perform this task attention had to be locked onto the target and shift with it. Half of the runs were performed overtly and half covertly. The event of interest consisted of the shift in the location of the attentional target. The state of maintained attention occurring in between the shifts constituted the baseline. The superior parietal gyrus was activated bilaterally in response to attentional shifts. No other area showed a significant response to shifting. On the left side the amplitude of the superior parietal response correlated positively with the distance of the shift. On the right side a significant correlation was present only for overt shifts. In a separate experiment we compared the maintaining of attention at a single spatial location to passive fixation: the frontal eye fields, anterior cingulate, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and inferior parietal lobule were significantly activated, indicating that the absence of a shift-related response in these areas in the main experiment was due to the fact that; they were equally activated by maintaining and shifting attention. The response to spatial shifts and the correlation with the distance between the original and the new location points to a specific role of the superior parietal gyrus in shifting the locus of spatial attention.

TBD,,Jackson,Bailey,860,THE ROLE OF POSITION IN OBJECT SELECTION IN VISION,"Within contemporary visual-information-processing psychology, two classes of selective-attention theories can be distinguished: position-not-special theories and position-special theories. The position-not-special theories postulate that attentional selection by colour, by form, and by position are equivalent selective operations. The position-special theories assume that selection by position is more basic or direct than selection by colour or by form. Examples of both types of theory are briefly described, and irrelevant and relevant evidence is critically discussed. It is concluded that the relevant evidence is directly compatible with the position-special views and that the position-not-special theories require additional extraneous assumptions. The position-special model presented in Van der Heijden (1992) is elaborated in further detail. It is shown that this model is compatible with two important and often substantiated assumptions of the position-not-special theories: the assumption that pre-attentive analysers organize the visual scene in objects against a background, and the assumption that visual-selective attention can be directed at objects isolated in this way. This position-special theory is a parsimonious theory because it can identify the mentalistic concept selective attention with the materialistic concept spatial position.",Article,1993,"VANDERHEIJDEN, AHC",PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH-PSYCHOLOGISCHE FORSCHUNG,NOV,10.1007/BF00572132,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00572132,
TBD,,Jackson,Bailey,861,The Control of Visual Attention: Toward a Unified Account,"Visual attention is deployed through visual scenes to find behaviorally relevant targets. This attentional deployment-or attentional control-can be based on either stimulus factors, such as the salience of an object or region, or goal relevance, such as the match between an object and the target being searched for. Decades of research have measured attentional control by examining attentional interruption by a completely irrelevant distracting object, which may or may not capture attention. Based on the results of attentional capture tasks, the literature has distilled two alternative views of attentional control and capture: one focused on stimulus-driven factors and the other based on goal-driven factors. In the current paper, we propose an alternative in which stimulus-driven control and goal-driven control are not mutually exclusive but instead related through task dynamics, specifically experience. Attentional control is initially stimulus-driven. However, as participants gain experience with all aspects of a task, attentional control rapidly becomes increasingly goal-driven. We present four experiments that examine this experience-dependent attentional tuning. We show that to resist capture and be highly selective based on target properties, attention must be configured to aspects of a task through experience.",Article; Book Chapter,2014,"Vecera, SP; Cosman, JD; Vatterott, DB; Roper, ZJJ","PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING AND MOTIVATION, VOL 60",,10.1016/B978-0-12-800090-8.00008-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-800090-8.00008-1,
TBD,,Jackson,Bailey,862,Eye gaze does not produce reflexive shifts of attention: Evidence from frontal-lobe damage,"Humans are able to predict the behavior of others using visual information. Several studies have argued that social cues, such as eye gaze direction, can influence the allocation of visual attention in a reflexive manner. We have previously shown that a patient with frontal-lobe damage, patient EVR, can use peripheral cues to direct attention but cannot use either word cues or gaze cues to allocate attention. These findings suggest that 'social attention' may involve frontal-lobe processes that control voluntary, not automatic, shifts of visuospatial attention. In the current paper, we further examine 'social attention' in EVR and demonstrate that his failure to orient attention voluntarily cannot be attributed to either cue predictability or a 'sluggish' attentional system. EVR exhibits a general impairment in orienting attention endogenously, and this impairment includes orienting from gaze cues. Gaze cues direct attention in a voluntary, not a reflexive, manner.

In Experiment 1 participants searched a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) sequence for a prespecified target letter that usually appeared in a cued color. ERPs elicited by cued-color distractors were similar to those elicited by targets, indicating relatively complete distractor processing. In Experiment 2 one letter in the RSVP sequence was framed by an irrelevant distractor probe in either the cued color or an uncued color. Such distractor probes elicited a P1, N1, or P2 sequence that depended on their color. In addition, probes presented shortly before the target tended to suppress the ERP components associated with target processing, especially for probes in the cued color.

While the AB has been shown to impact many processes, it is still unclear whether this includes the ability to shift spatial attention. The present study examined this question using a more sensitive dependent measure than past studies; namely, response times. It also evaluated whether masking of the cue stimulus modulated the effect of the AB on spatial shifts. The results showed significant cueing effects on T2 response times that were strongly modulated by the AB.

In Experiment 1, 40 undergraduate students were randomly assigned to either a free-recall or focused-attention condition. In Experiment 2, 40 undergraduate students completed a dichotic listening task with exogenous cueing. They were randomly assigned to either a 150-ms stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) or a 450-ms SOA condition. In Experiment 3, 20 participants completed a task where the SOA for the exogenous cue was randomized on a trial to trial basis. Results indicated that focused attention increased the magnitude of the laterality effect. Contrary to predictions, this finding was not due to reduced variability in the focused-attention task compared to the free-recall task. In addition, a cueing tone was only effective at directing attention in Experiment 3. Specifically, a significant right car advantage observed at the 150-ms SOA was reduced at the 450-ms SOA. It appears that, in Experiment 3, the tone was effective at controlling attention because it reduced the systematic bias that has been suggested to account for the laterality effects observed in dichotic tasks.

TBD,,Jackson,Bailey,867,The ventriloquist effect does not depend on the direction of automatic visual attention,"Previously, we showed that the visual bias of auditory sound location, or ventriloquism, does not depend on the direction of deliberate, or endogenous, attention (Bertelson, Vroomen, de Gelder, & Driver, 2000). In the present study, a similar question concerning automatic, or exogenous, attention was examined. The experimental manipulation was based on the fact that exogenous visual attention can be attracted toward a singleton - that is, an item different on some dimension from all other items presented simultaneously. A display was used that consisted of a row of four bright squares with one square, in either the left- or the rightmost position, smaller than the others, serving as the singleton. In Experiment 1, subjects made dichotomous left-right judgments concerning sound bursts, whose successive locations were controlled by a psychophysical staircase procedure and which were presented in synchrony with a display with the singleton either left or right. Results showed that the apparent location of the sound was attracted not toward the singleton, but instead toward the big squares at the opposite end of the display. Experiment 2 was run to check that the singleton effectively attracted exogenous attention. The task was to discriminate target letters presented either on the singleton or on the opposite big square. Performance deteriorated when the target was on the big square opposite the singleton, in comparison with control trials with no singleton, thus showing that the singleton attracted attention away from the target location. In Experiment 3, localization and discrimination trials were mixed randomly so as to control for potential differences in subjects' strategies in the two preceding experiments. Results were as before, showing that the singleton attracted attention, whereas sound localization was shifted away from the singleton. Ventriloquism can thus be dissociated from exogenous visual attention and appears to reflect sensory interactions with little role for the direction of visual spatial attention.",Article,2001,"Vroomen, J; Bertelson, P; de Gelder, B",PERCEPTION & PSYCHOPHYSICS,MAY,10.3758/BF03194427,http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/BF03194427,

The present experiments manipulated the proportion of valid trials (the proportion of trials in which a cue appeared in the same location as the upcoming target word) so as to encourage distributed (50% valid cues; Experiments 1 and 3) or focused (100% valid cues; Experiments 2 and 4) spatial attention in a priming-type paradigm. Participants read aloud a target word, and the impact of a simultaneously presented distractor word was assessed. Semantic and orthographic priming effects were present when conditions promoted distributed spatial attention but absent when conditions promoted focused spatial attention. In contrast, Experiment 5 yielded a distractor word effect in the 100% valid cue condition when subjects identified a colour (Stroop task). We take these results to suggest that (1) spatial attention is a necessary preliminary to visual word recognition and (2) examining the role of spatial attention in the context of the Stroop task may have few implications for basic processes in reading because colour processing makes fewer demands on spatial attention than does visual word recognition.",Article,2011,"Waechter, S; Besner, D; Stolz, JA",VISUAL COGNITION,,10.1080/13506285.2010.517228,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13506285.2010.517228,
TBD,,Jackson,Bailey,869,Statistical regularities bias overt attention,"A previous study employing the additional singleton paradigm showed that a singleton distractor that appeared more often in one specific location interfered less with target search than when it appeared at any other location. These findings suggested that through statistical learning the location that was likely to contain a distractor was suppressed relative to all other locations. Even though feasible, it isalso possible that this effect is due to faster disengagement of attention from the high-probability distractor location. The present study tested this hypothesis using a variant of the additional singleton task adapted for eye tracking in which observers made a speeded saccade to a shape singleton and gave a manual response. The singleton distractor was presented more often at one location than all other locations. Consistent with the suppression hypothesis, we found that fewer saccades landed at the high-probability distractor location than any other location. Also, when a target appeared at the high-probability location, saccade latencies towards the target were higher than latencies towards the target when it was presented at other locations. Furthermore, in addition to suppression, we also found evidence for faster disengagement from the high-probability distractor location than the low-probability distractor location; however, this effect was relatively small. The current findings support the notion that through statistical learning plasticity is induced in the spatial priority map of attentional selection so that the high-probability distractor location is suppressed compared to any other location.",Article,2019,"Wan, BC; Samara, I; Theeuwes, J",ATTENTION PERCEPTION & PSYCHOPHYSICS,AUG,10.3758/s13414-019-01708-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/s13414-019-01708-5,
TBD,,Jackson,Bailey,870,Item-specific control of attention capture: An eye movement study,"Measures of attentional capture are sensitive to attentional control settings. Recent research suggests that such control settings can be linked associatively to specific items. Rapid item-specific retrieval of these control settings can then modulate measures of attentional capture. However, the processes that produce this item-specific control of attentional capture are unclear. The current study addressed this issue by examining eye-movement patterns associated with the item-specific proportion congruency effect (ISPC). Participants searched for a shape singleton target in search displays that also contained a colour singleton-the colour singleton was either the same item as the shape singleton (congruent trials) or a different item (incongruent trials). The relative proportions of congruent and incongruent trials were manipulated separately for two distinct item types that were randomly intermixed. Response times (RTs) were faster on congruent than incongruent trials, and this congruency effect was larger for high-proportion congruent (HPC) than low-proportion congruent (LPC) items. Eye movement data revealed a higher proportion of saccades towards the distractor and longer dwell times on the distractor in the HPC condition.

TBD,,Jackson,Bailey,871,Stimuli that signal the availability of reward break into attentional focus,"Mounting evidence has shown that a task-irrelevant, previously reward-associated stimulus can capture attention even when attending to this stimulus impairs the processing of the current target. Here we investigate whether a stimulus that merely signals the availability of reward could capture attention and interfere with target processing when it is located outside of attentional focus. In three experiments, a target was always presented at the bottom of the lower visual field to attract focal attention. A distractor signalling high or low reward availability for the current trial was presented around the target with a variable distance between them. This distractor was task-irrelevant; getting distracted by it could potentially result in an omission of reward. For the high-reward condition, the distractor located adjacent to the target more severely interfered with target processing than the distractor at a relatively distant location; for the low-reward condition, distractors at different locations had the same impact upon target processing. Relative to the low-reward distractor, the high-reward distractor impaired target processing, but only at the location adjacent to the target. When the target location was uncertain such that attention was unable to be directed to the target in advance, the high-reward distractor interfered with target processing at both the adjacent and distant locations. Overall, these results suggest that a task-irrelevant stimulus can break into focus of attention by simply signalling the availability of reward even when getting distracted by this stimulus is counterproductive to obtaining reward.",Article,2018,"Wang, LH; Li, S; Zhou, XL; Theeuwes, J",VISION RESEARCH,MAR,10.1016/j.visres.2017.10.008,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.visres.2017.10.008,
TBD,,Jackson,Bailey,872,Reward Breaks Through Center-Surround Inhibition via Anterior Insula,"Focusing attention on a target creates a center-surround inhibition such that distractors located close to the target do not capture attention. Recent research showed that a distractor can break through this surround inhibition when associated with reward. However, the brain basis for this reward-based attention is unclear. In this fMRI study, we presented a distractor associated with high or low reward at different distances from the target. Behaviorally the low-reward distractor did not capture attention and thus did not cause interference, whereas the high-reward distractor captured attention only when located near the target. Neural activity in extrastriate cortex mirrored the behavioral pattern. A comparison between the high-reward and the low-reward distractors presented near the target (i.e., reward-based attention) and a comparison between the high-reward distractors located near and far from the target (i.e., spatial attention) revealed a common frontoparietal network, including inferior frontal gyrus and inferior parietal sulcus as well as the visual cortex. Reward-based attention specifically activated the anterior insula (AI). Dynamic causal modelling showed that reward modulated the connectivity from AI to the frontoparietal network but not the connectivity from the frontoparietal network to the visual cortex. Across participants, the reward-based attentional effect could be predicted both by the activity in AI and by the changes of spontaneous functional connectivity between AI and ventral striatum before and after reward association. These results suggest that AI encodes reward-based salience and projects it to the stimulus-driven attentional network, which enables the reward-associated distractor to break through the surround inhibition in the visual cortex.

Explicit recognition demand was imposed in Experiment 2 by an additional recognition task.

The high altitude group responded slower than the low altitude group, while bilateral N1 activity was found only in the high altitude group. The P3 amplitude was smaller in the high altitude compared to the low altitude group only under high perceptual load. These results suggest that long-term exposure to high altitudes causes hemispheric compensation during discrimination processes at early processing stages and reduces attentional resources at late processing stages.

The digit could appear in the cued peripheral box or in the central box, thus guaranteeing a saccadic response to the cue in one condition and maintenance of fixation in the other.

TBD,,Jackson,Bailey,877,Spatial Representations as an Emergent Feature of Perceptual Processing Evidence from Human Electrophysiology,"Spatial selection of relevant information has been proposed to reflect an emergent feature of stimulus processing within an integrated network of perceptual areas. Stimulus-based and intention-based sources of information might converge in a common stage when spatial maps are generated. This approach appears to be inconsistent with the assumption of distinct mechanisms for stimulus-driven and top-down controlled attention. In two experiments, the common ground of stimulus-driven and intention-based attention was tested by means of event-related potentials (ERPs) in the human EEG. In both experiments, the processing of a single transient was compared to the selection of a physically comparable stimulus among distractors. While single transients evoked a spatially sensitive N1, the extraction of relevant information out of a more complex display was reflected in an N2pc. The high similarity of the spatial portion of these two components (Experiment 1), and the replication of this finding for the vertical axis (Experiment 2) indicate that these two ERP components might both reflect the spatial representation of relevant information as derived from the organization of perceptual maps, just at different points in time.",Article,2010,"Wascher, E; Beste, C",JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY,,10.1027/0269-8803/a000007,http://dx.doi.org/10.1027/0269-8803/a000007,

However, advance information about the side of a response (intentional cueing) enhances the Simon effect. At first sight, these well-established results contradict two important assumptions about the origin of the Simon effect: (a) the effect originates at least in part in a covert shift of visual attention that forces the preparation of a response towards the location of the attentional shift and (b) interference between stimulus location and response side takes place within a response selection stage. We replicated the behavioral finding in a study that measured event-related potentials (ERPs) of the EEG. ERPs indicated that the mechanisms causing the Simon effect remain widely unaffected by advance information. Clear evidence for both response preparation and attentional shifts in the cue-target interval was found. Additionally, ERPs suggested that the increment of the Simon effect by intentional cueing might be due to perceptual factors rather than to an alteration in the mechanisms involved in the generation of a regular Simon effect.

TBD,,Jackson,Bailey,879,Allocation of attention during pursuit of large objects is no different than during fixation,"Attention allocation during pursuit of a spot is usually characterized as asymmetric with more attention placed ahead of the target than behind it. However, attention is symmetrically allocated across larger pursuit stimuli. An unresolved issue is how tightly attention is constrained on large stimuli during pursuit. Although some work shows it is tightly locked to the fovea, other work shows it is allocated flexibly. To investigate this, we had observers perform a character identification task on large pursuit stimuli composed of arrays of five, nine, or 15 characters spaced between 0.68 and 4.08 apart. Initially, the characters were identical, but at a random time, they all changed briefly, rendering one of them unique. Observers identified the unique character. Consistent with previous literature, attention appeared narrow and symmetric around the pursuit target for tightly spaced ( 0.68) characters. Increasing spacing dramatically expanded the attention scope, presumably by mitigating crowding. However, when we controlled for crowding, performance was limited by set size, suffering more for eccentric targets. Interestingly, the same limitations on attention allocation were observed with stationary and pursued stimuli-evidence that attention operates similarly during fixation and pursuit of a stimulus that extends into the periphery. The results suggest that attention is flexibly allocated during pursuit, but performance is limited by crowding and set size. In addition, performing the identification task did not hurt pursuit performance, further evidence that pursuit of large stimuli is relatively inattentive.",Article,2015,"Watamaniuk, SNJ; Heinen, SJ",JOURNAL OF VISION,,10.1167/15.9.9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1167/15.9.9,

Subjects were asked to quickly move their eyes toward one of two stimuli that were presented closely and simultaneously. Most subjects showed a clear tendency toward saccadic averaging. When an uninformative cue was presented 600 ms before the two stimuli (long enough to produce IOR), saccadic averaging still occurred but the saccade landing locations were biased toward the uncued location.

Observers saw two objects (circles) moving vertically in opposite directions, one in each visual hemifield. Two horizontal bars were simultaneously flashed at horizontally collinear positions with the fixation point at various timings. When the movement of the object was fully visible, the flashed bar appeared shifted in the motion direction of the circle. But this position-capture effect occurred only when the bar was presented ahead of or on the moving circle. Even when the motion trajectory was covered by an opaque surface and the bar was flashed after complete occlusion of the circle, the position-capture effect was still observed, though the positional asymmetry was less clear. These results show that movements of both visible and 'hidden' objects can modulate the perception of positions of flashed stimuli and suggest that a high-level representation of 'objects in motion' plays an important role in the position-capture effect.",Article,2003,"Watanabe, K; Sato, TR; Shimojo, S",PERCEPTION,,10.1068/p5047,http://dx.doi.org/10.1068/p5047,
TBD,,Jackson,Bailey,883,Resisting change: The influence of luminance changes on visual marking and the preview benefit,"Visual search can benefit when one set of distractors is presented as a preview, prior to the appearance of the second set of distractors plus the target (Watson & Humphreys, 1997). It has been shown that changing the shape of the old, previewed stimuli when the new items appear causes the old stimuli to recompete for selection with the new ones. In contrast, changing the luminance or color of the old stimuli has no detrimental effects. Here, we present five experiments that reassessed the effect of luminance changes in preview search. We show (1) that preview search is remarkably resistant to large changes in the absolute luminance of the old stimuli, even when those changes would ordinarily be sufficient to signal the appearance of a new object and draw attention (Experiments I and 2), and (2) that resistance to luminance changes can be bolstered by feature-based inhibitory processes (Experiments 3-5). These findings are discussed in terms of the possible ecological properties of time-based visual selection and possible mechanisms underlying the preview benefit.",Article,2008,"Watson, DG; Braithwaite, JJ; Humphreys, GW",PERCEPTION & PSYCHOPHYSICS,NOV,10.3758/PP.70.8.1526,http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/PP.70.8.1526,

TBD,,Jackson,Bailey,886,ATTENTION CAPTURE BY CONTOUR ONSETS AND OFFSETS - NO SPECIAL ROLE FOR ONSETS,"In five experiments, we investigated the power of targets defined by the onset or offset of one of an object's parts (contour onsets and offsets) either to guide or to capture visual attention. In Experiment 1, search for a single contour onset target was compared with search for a single contour offset target against a static background of distractors; no difference was found between the efficiency with which each could be detected. In Experiment 2, onsets and offsets were compared for automatic attention capture, when both occurred simultaneously. Unlike in previous studies, the effects of overall luminance change, new-object creation, and number of onset and offset items were controlled. It was found that contour onset and offset items captured attention equally well. However, display size effects on both target types were also apparent. Such effects may have been due to competition for selection between multiple onset and offset stimuli. In Experiments 3 and 4, single onset and offset stimuli were presented simultaneously and pitted directly against one another among a background of static distractors. In Experiment 3, we examined ''guided search,'' for a target that was formed either from an onset or from an offset among static items. In Experiment 4, the onsets and offsets were uncorrelated with the target location. Similar results occurred in both experiments: target onsets and offsets were detected more efficiently than static stimuli which needed serial search; there remained effects of display size on performance; but there was still no advantage for onsets. In Experiment 5, we examined automatic attention capture by single onset and offset stimuli presented individually among static distractors. Again, there was no advantage for onset over offset targets and a display size effect was also present. These results suggest that, both in isolation and in competition, onsets that do not form new objects neither guide nor gain automatic attention more efficiently than offsets. In addition, in contrast to previous studies in which onsets formed new objects, contour onsets and offsets did not reliably capture attention automatically.",Article,1995,"WATSON, DG; HUMPHREYS, GW",PERCEPTION & PSYCHOPHYSICS,JUL,10.3758/BF03213264,http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/BF03213264,

One way to do this is to prioritise processing at a particular location in space. However, there are many situations where this strategy is not possible and recent studies have shown that, in such circumstances, observers can use time as well as space to prioritise selection.

TBD,,Jackson,Bailey,888,The impact of predictive cues and visual working memory on dynamic oculomotor selection,"Strategic use of advanced information about search display properties can benefit covert attentional selection. However, little work has investigated this benefit on overt selection. The present study examined how cued information impacts oculomotor selection over time and the role played by individual differences in visual working memory (VWM) capacity in utilizing such cues. Participants searched for a specific orientation target in a saccade localization search task. Prior to each trial, additional information regarding secondary display features (color singleton identity) was either provided by a word cue or not. The cue increased accuracy performance from the earliest saccadic responses. VWM capacity was measured via a change-detection task and results showed that individuals' VWM capacity scores were associated with cue impact, whereby participants with higher capacity derived an increased cue performance benefit. These findings suggest that strategic use of cue information to select and reject salient singletons can develop very early following display presentation and is related to an individual's VWM capacity. This research indicates that stimulus-driven and goal-directed processes are not simply additive in oculomotor selection, but instead exhibit a distinct and dynamic profile of interaction.",Article,2014,"Weaver, MD; Paoletti, D; van Zoest, W",JOURNAL OF VISION,,10.1167/14.3.27,http://dx.doi.org/10.1167/14.3.27,

Participants identified 2 target letters embedded among distractor letters in a rapid serial visual presentation sequence. In some trials, a square frame was inserted between the targets; as the only geometric object in the sequence, it constituted a singleton. Capture effects obtained when the AB was most severe and when it was over were compared. There were 3 main results. First, capture occurred even when the AB was crippling, suggesting that a singleton exogenously engaged attention even when processing of a previous target was continuing apace. Second, when the singleton contained the key target feature, capture effects were clearly manifest. Third, even when the singleton did not possess the key target feature, it still succeeded in capturing attention, although the effects were both feeble and fleeting.",Article; Proceedings Paper,2004,"Wee, S; Chua, FK",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-HUMAN PERCEPTION AND PERFORMANCE,JUN,10.1037/0096-1523.30.3.598,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0096-1523.30.3.598,
TBD,,Jackson,Bailey,891,Processing multidimensional objects under different perceptual loads: The priority of bottom-up perceptual saliency,"The role of perceptual load in selective attention to multidimensional objects was investigated by independently manipulating the load along the task-relevant and the task-irrelevant dimensions in the central search array, which was flanked by congruent, incongruent, or neutral peripheral distractors. The relative bottom-up perceptual saliency of these dimensions in capturing attention was manipulated between experiments. When the task-relevant dimension was the color of the letter and the task-irrelevant dimension was the visual shape of the letter (Experiment 1), manipulation of the letter shape perceptual load had no impact upon the pattern of congruency effects in responding to the color, i.e., smaller congruency effects under higher color perceptual loads and larger congruency effects under lower color perceptual loads. When the task-relevant dimension was the shape of the letter and the task-irrelevant dimension was the color of the letter (Experiment 2), there were no congruency effects in responding to the letter shape under high color perceptual loads irrespective of the letter shape loads. When only the target and the flanker were colored whereas the distractors in the central array were not (Experiment 3), the task-irrelevant color information reduced or eliminated the impact of letter shape perceptual load on the congruency effects in responding to the letter shape. These findings suggested that selective attention to multidimensional objects follows the general principles suggested by the perceptual load theory, but the bottom-up perceptual saliency plays a primary role in the distribution of attentional resources over objects and dimensions.

TBD,,Jackson,Bailey,893,Computational assessment of visual search strategies in volumetric medical images,"When searching through volumetric images [e.g., computed tomography (CT)], radiologists appear to use two different search strategies: drilling (restrict eye movements to a small region of the image while quickly scrolling through slices), or scanning (search over large areas at a given depth before moving on to the next slice). To computationally identify the type of image information that is used in these two strategies, 23 naive observers were instructed with either drilling or scanning when searching for target T's in 20 volumes of faux lung CTs. We computed saliency maps using both classical two-dimensional (2-D) saliency, and a three-dimensional (3-D) dynamic saliency that captures the characteristics of scrolling through slices. Comparing observers' gaze distributions with the saliency maps showed that search strategy alters the type of saliency that attracts fixations. Drillers' fixations aligned better with dynamic saliency and scanners with 2-D saliency. The computed saliency was greater for detected targets than for missed targets. Similar results were observed in data from 19 radiologists who searched five stacks of clinical chest CTs for lung nodules. Dynamic saliency may be superior to the 2-D saliency for detecting targets embedded in volumetric images, and thus drilling may be more efficient than scanning.

Appropriate visual warning signals which support drivers in their attention allocation and driving behavior could be useful to improve drivers' reaction. In a driving simulator study, two warning strategies varying in their timing: (1) top-down warning while approaching a critical intersection and (2) bottom-up warning directly before the critical incident were investigated in a T-intersection situation. For the bottom-up warning, two warning signal designs were compared. 48 subjects (M = 27.3 years, SD = 7.4 years) participated in the study. Driving data as well as subjective evaluation of the three warning signals (one early and two late warning signals) were analyzed. The early warning signal which was given while approaching the intersection showed a positive effect. Here, most collisions could be avoided due to drivers' adaptation of their driving behavior toward safer driving. They waited longer at the intersection before turning and finally turned with a lower velocity. In addition, drivers evaluated the early warning signal as very useful. With regard to the late warnings a much smaller effect was found. From these results, requirements can be derived for the design of effective warning strategies when driving at critical intersections. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Salient peripheral warning signals could disrupt these strategies and direct drivers' attention towards these road users. To select effective warning signals, the SEE was developed as a laboratory task requiring visual-cognitive processes similar to those used at intersections. For validation of the SEE, four experiments were conducted using different stimulus characteristics (size, colour contrast, shape, flashing) that influence peripheral vision.

However, during informative (75% valid) cue conditions, older adults demonstrated less efficient use of this cue-related top-down information. The authors extended these findings in Experiment 2 using cues that were either consistent or inconsistent with top-down feature settings. Results from this second experiment showed that although older adults were capable of avoiding attentional capture when provided with top-down information related to target features, capture effects for older adults were notably larger than those of younger adults when only bottom-up information was available.

Personality also plays a role in constraining how we learn to perceive the world and it is conceivable that some facets of personality interact with visual attention; however, the relationship between these two constitutional aspects of psychology remains unclear. To address this interplay between cognition and personality, we looked at how the Big Five personality traits relate to the spatial scope of attention, as indexed by the spatial distribution of Inhibition of Return (IOR). IOR is marked by a decrement in reaction time when a target appears at a cued location, more than 200 ms after that cue. As the cue/target distance increases there is a release from inhibition, providing a measure of the spatial distribution of IOR and reflecting the spatial scope of attention. The results presented here show personality does predict the distribution of IOR. Specifically, higher trait Openness is associated with a broader distribution of IOR and attention.

Here, we investigated under what conditions such a bias occurs in unselected samples. According to contingent-capture theory, an irrelevant cue only captures attention if it matches an attentional control setting. Therefore, we first tested the hypothesis that an attentional control setting tuned to threat must be activated in (non-anxious) individuals. In Experiment 1, we used a dot-probe task with a manipulation of attentional control settings (threat' - set vs. control set). Surprisingly, we found an (anxiety-independent) attentional bias to angry faces that was not moderated by attentional control settings. Since we presented two stimuli (i.e., a target and a distractor) on the target screen in Experiment 1 (a necessity to realise the test of contingent capture), but most dot-probe studies only employ a single target, we conducted Experiment 2 to test the hypothesis that attentional bias in the general population is contingent on target competition. Participants performed a dot-probe task, involving presentation of a stand-alone target or a target competing with a distractor.

TBD,,Jackson,Bailey,901,Guided Search 6.0: An updated model of visual search,"This paper describes Guided Search 6.0 (GS6), a revised model of visual search. When we encounter a scene, we can see something everywhere. However, we cannot recognize more than a few items at a time. Attention is used to select items so that their features can be bound into recognizable objects. Attention is guided so that items can be processed in an intelligent order. In GS6, this guidance comes from five sources of preattentive information: (1) top-down and (2) bottom-up feature guidance, (3) prior history (e.g., priming), (4) reward, and (5) scene syntax and semantics. These sources are combined into a spatial priority map, a dynamic attentional landscape that evolves over the course of search. Selective attention is guided to the most active location in the priority map approximately 20 times per second. Guidance will not be uniform across the visual field. It will favor items near the point of fixation. Three types of functional visual field (FVFs) describe the nature of these foveal biases. There is a resolution FVF, an FVF governing exploratory eye movements, and an FVF governing covert deployments of attention. To be identified as targets or rejected as distractors, items must be compared to target templates held in memory. The binding and recognition of an attended object is modeled as a diffusion process taking > 150 ms/item. Since selection occurs more frequently than that, it follows that multiple items are undergoing recognition at the same time, though asynchronously, making GS6 a hybrid of serial and parallel processes. In GS6, if a target is not found, search terminates when an accumulating quitting signal reaches a threshold. Setting of that threshold is adaptive, allowing feedback about performance to shape subsequent searches. Simulation shows that the combination of asynchronous diffusion and a quitting signal can produce the basic patterns of response time and error data from a range of search experiments.",Review,2021,"Wolfe, JM",PSYCHONOMIC BULLETIN & REVIEW,AUG,10.3758/s13423-020-01859-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/s13423-020-01859-9,
TBD,,Jackson,Bailey,902,GUIDED SEARCH 2.0 - A REVISED MODEL OF VISUAL-SEARCH,"An important component of routine visual behavior is the ability to find one item in a visual world filled with other, distracting items. This ability to perform visual search has been the subject of a large body of research in the past 15 years. This paper reviews the visual search literature and presents a model of human search behavior. Built upon the work of Neisser, Treisman, Julesz, and others, the model distinguishes between a preattentive, massively parallel stage that processes information about basic visual features (color, motion, various depth cues, etc.) across large portions of the visual field and a subsequent limited-capacity stage that performs other, more complex operations (e.g., face recognition, reading, object identification) over a limited portion of the visual field. The spatial deployment of the limited-capacity process is under attentional control. The heart of the guided search model is the idea that attentional deployment of limited resources is guided by the output of the earlier parallel processes. Guided Search 2.0 (GS2) is a revision of the model in which virtually all aspects of the model have been made more explicit and/or revised in light of new data. The paper is organized into four parts: Part 1 presents the model and the details of its computer simulation. Part 2 reviews the visual search literature on preattentive processing of basic features and shows how the GS2 simulation reproduces those results. Part 3 reviews the literature on the attentional deployment of limited-capacity processes in conjunction and serial searches and shows how the simulation handles those conditions.

TBD,,Jackson,Bailey,904,The anti-orienting phenomenon revisited: effects of gaze cues on antisaccade performance,"When the eye gaze of a face is congruent with the direction of an upcoming target, saccadic eye movements of the observer towards that target are generated more quickly, in comparison with eye gaze incongruent with the direction of the target. This work examined the conflict in an antisaccade task, when eye gaze points towards the target, but the saccadic eye movement should be triggered in the opposite direction. In a gaze cueing paradigm, a central face provided an attentional gaze cue towards the target or away from the target. Participants (N = 38) generated pro- and antisaccades to peripheral targets that were congruent or incongruent with the previous gaze cue. Paradoxically, facilitatory effects of a gaze cue towards the target were observed for both the pro- and antisaccade tasks. The results are consistent with the idea that eye gaze cues are processed in the task set that is compatible with the saccade programme. Thus, in an antisaccade paradigm, participants may anti-orient with respect to the gaze cue, resulting in faster saccades on trials when the gaze cue is towards the target.

In the first experiment, our results were the opposite of those in Belopolsky and Theeuwes (Attention, Perception & Psychophysics 71(3):620-631, 2009), in that we found facilitation (shorter saccade latencies) instead of inhibition when the saccade target matched the region in spatial working memory. In Experiment 2, we sought to determine whether the spatial working memory effect would generalize to other endogenous cuing tasks, such as a central arrow that pointed to one of six possible peripheral locations. As in Experiment 1, we found that saccade programming was facilitated when the cued location coincided with the saccade target. In Experiment 3, we explored how spatial memory interacts with other types of cues, such as a peripheral color singleton target or irrelevant onset. In both cases, the eyes were more likely to go to either singleton when it coincided with the location held in spatial working memory. On the basis of these results, we conclude that spatial working memory and saccade programming are likely to share common overlapping circuitry.",Article,2013,"Wong, JH; Peterson, MS",ATTENTION PERCEPTION & PSYCHOPHYSICS,FEB,10.3758/s13414-012-0388-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/s13414-012-0388-7,
TBD,,Jackson,Bailey,906,Masked-target recovery requires focused attention on the target object,"Flashing a homogeneous light mask after the presentation of a masked target reduces the deleterious effects of the mask, a phenomenon often called target recovery. Target recovery has been studied using masking paradigms in which a target object is presented in isolation prior to the presentation of a mask, thus capturing attention. In the present study, we examined whether target recovery is possible when a target does not benefit from attentional capture. We hypothesized that target recovery would be eliminated when a target must compete with distractors for perceptual attention. Replicating classic studies, we observed target recovery when pattern and light masks followed an isolated target. However, target recovery was not observed when a light mask followed a masked visual search target. Furthermore, using an attentional-capture paradigm we found that sudden onset search targets were recoverable whereas nononset targets were not. The present findings indicate that attentional capture by a target prior to masking plays a critical role in the subsequent recovery of the target.",Article,2007,"Woodman, GF; Yi, DJ",VISUAL COGNITION,,10.1080/13506280600859748,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13506280600859748,

Single and multiple cueing effects were similar, even when targets were presented at locations ''in between'' pairs of cues. This implies that pairs of direct stimulus cues are not processed by an attentional focus of variable spatial extent that encompasses both cued locations. If this were the case, then targets presented in between cued locations would fall within such an attentional focus and identification response times should have been reduced. The increase in these response times that actually occurred when a target was presented at uncued locations in between a pair of cued locations suggests that pairs of cued locations are encoded independently by an operation called spatial indexing.

Moreover, recognition of the presence of contour gaps was significantly below the chance level.

These displays consisted of one to four simultaneously presented direct location cues. The results indicated that direct location cuing can produce cue effects that are mediated, in part, by nonattentional processing that occurs simultaneously at multiple locations. When single cues were presented in isolation, however, the resulting cue effect appeared to be due to a combination of sensory processing and attentional capture by the cue. This suggests that the faster responses produced by direct cues may be associated with two different components: an attention-related component that can be modulated by goal-driven factors and a nonattentional component that occurs in parallel at multiple direct-cue locations and is minimally affected by goal-driven factors.",Article,2003,"Wright, RD; Richard, CM",PERCEPTION & PSYCHOPHYSICS,AUG,10.3758/BF03194824,http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/BF03194824,
TBD,,Jackson,Bailey,910,Location cue validity affects inhibition of return of visual processing,"Inhibition-of-return is the process by which visual search for an object positioned among others is biased toward novel rather than previously inspected items. It is thought to occur automatically and to increase search efficiency. We examined this phenomenon by studying the facilitative and inhibitory effects of location cueing on target-detection response times in a search task. The results indicated that facilitation was a reflexive consequence of cueing whereas inhibition appeared to depend on cue informativeness. More specifically, the inhibition-of-return effect occurred only when the cue provided no information about the impending target's location. We suggest that the results are consistent with the notion of two levels of visual processing. The first involves rapid and reflexive operations that underlie the facilitative effects of location cueing on target detection. The second involves a rapid but goal-driven inhibition procedure that the perceiver can invoke if doing so will enhance visual search performance. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In particular, the magnitudes of costs of invalid location cuing and of benefits of valid location cuing can be determined by comparing invalid and valid cue responses to location-nonspecific neutral cue responses. Cost/benefit analysis is based on the assumption that neutral baseline measures reflect a general warning effect about the impending target's onset but no other specific target information. The experiments we report were carried out to determine the appropriateness of two baseline measures for cost/benefit analyses of direct (nonsymbolic) location cuing effects. We found that a multiple-cue baseline attenuated the benefits of valid cuing, and that a background-flash baseline arbitrarily attenuated costs or benefits depending on flash intensity. It is proposed that a background flash is the more suitable neutral cue because it is target-location-nonspecific, but that its intensity should be adjusted to elicit a target-onset warning signal of the same magnitude as the location cues with which it will be compared.",Article,1995,"Wright, RD; Richard, CM; McDonald, JJ",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE PSYCHOLOGIE EXPERIMENTALE,DEC,10.1037/1196-1961.49.4.540,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/1196-1961.49.4.540,

TBD,,Jackson,Bailey,913,Follow Your Nose: Implicit Spatial Processing Within the Chemosensory Systems,"Although most studies agree that humans cannot smell in stereo, it was recently suggested that olfactory localization is possible when assessed implicitly. In a spatial cueing paradigm, lateralized olfactory cues impaired the detection of congruently presented visual targets, an effect contrary to the typical facilitation observed in other sensory domains. Here, we examined the specificity and the robustness of this finding by studying implicit localization abilities in another chemosensory system and by accounting for possible confounds in a modified paradigm. Sixty participants completed a spatial cueing task along with an explicit localization task, using trigeminal (Experiment 1) and olfactory (Experiment 2) stimuli. A control task was implemented to control for residual somatosensory stimulation (Experiment 3). In the trigeminal experiment, stimuli were localized with high accuracy on the explicit level, while the cueing effect in form of facilitation was limited to response accuracy. In the olfactory experiment, responses were slowed by congruent cues on the implicit level, while no explicit localization was observed. Our results point to the robustness of the olfactory interference effect, corroborating the implicit-explicit dissociation of olfactory localization, and challenging the view that humans lost the ability to extract spatial information from smell. The absence of a similar interference for trigeminal cues suggests distinct implicit spatial processing mechanisms within the chemosensory systems. Moreover, the lack of a typical facilitation effect in the trigeminal domain points to important differences from spatial information processing in other, nonchemosensory domains. The possible mechanisms driving the effects are discussed.",Article,2016,"Wudarczyk, OA; Habel, U; Turetsky, BI; Gur, RE; Kellermann, T; Schneider, F; Moessnang, C",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-HUMAN PERCEPTION AND PERFORMANCE,NOV,10.1037/xhp0000261,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/xhp0000261,

The dominant view attributes the Simon effect to automatic processes of location-based response priming. The automaticity view predicts insensitivity of the Simon effect to manipulations of processing load. Four experiments investigated the role of spatial and verbal WM in horizontal and vertical Simon tasks by using a dual-task approach. Participants maintained different amounts of spatial or verbal information in WM while performing a horizontal or vertical Simon task. Results showed that high load generally decreased, and sometimes eliminated, the Simon effect. It is interesting to note that spatial load had a larger impact than verbal load on the horizontal Simon effect, whereas verbal load had a larger impact than spatial load on the vertical Simon effect. The results highlight the role of WM as the perception-action interface in choice-response tasks. Moreover, the results suggest spatial coding of horizontal stimulus-response (S-R) tasks, and verbal coding of vertical S-R tasks.",Article,2011,"Wühr, P; Biebl, R",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-HUMAN PERCEPTION AND PERFORMANCE,APR,10.1037/a0020563,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0020563,

The present study compared Simon effects from the location of a relevant (i.e., to-be-attended) object to those from the location of an irrelevant (i.e., to-be-ignored) object. In four experiments, participants were presented with a rectangular frame and a square, with the relevant object in green or red color and the irrelevant object in gray or white color. Participants' task was to respond with a lateral keypress to the color of the relevant object, and we varied spatial correspondence between the location of the relevant or the irrelevant object and the response, respectively. Results consistently showed larger Simon effects from the location of the relevant than from the irrelevant object, even when the irrelevant object was made very salient.

Using the complimentary techniques of human fMRI and monkey electrophysiology in a context-dependent stop signal task, we found a functional double dissociation between the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (rVLPFC) and the bi-lateral frontal eye field (FEF). Different regions of rVLPFC were associated with context-based signal meaning versus intention to inhibit a response, while FEF activity corresponded to success or failure of the response inhibition regardless of the stimulus response mapping or the context. These results were validated by electrophysiological recordings in rVLPFC and FEF from one monkey.

The stop signal task (SST) has been used in many previous studies to examine the interactions between go and stop responses in a cognitively demanding task involving attention, conflict resolution, and motor plan selection. The current study uses a variant of the SST, in which the continue signal instructs participants to proceed with the go response they were preparing. Reaction times (RTs) on continue trials were bimodally distributed, suggesting that an aspect of inhibition was involved in at least some of the trials. We investigated whether the cognitive processes delaying the generation of a behavioural response on continue trials are the same as for stop trials. We found improvement of stop signal reaction times (SSRTs) following stop trials, but the decrease in continue signal reaction times (CSRTs) was not significant. No improvement in either SSRT or CSRT was found following continue trials, suggesting that activation of the processes delaying the response on continue trials is insufficient to drive subsequent adjustments in SSRT or CSRT. In addition, go RTs only slowed following stop trials. These effects may suggest the presence of a selective learning process, which requires that the initial inhibition captured by SSRT and CSRT be combined with recognition of the stop signal specifically to affect subsequent performance.",Article,2019,"Xu, KZ; Mayse, JD; Courtney, S",QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY,APR,10.1177/1747021818768721,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1747021818768721,
TBD,,Jackson,Bailey,918,Gaze-induced joint attention persists under high perceptual load and does not depend on awareness,"The automaticity of gaze-induced joint attention is well known in relatively easy cognitive tasks; but its role in harder tasks had never been examined. This encouraged us to study automaticity in hard tasks, tasks presenting the subjects with high perceptual loads. The Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) paradigm was used to present participants with two streams of bilaterally displayed digit-flows while they fixated at the center of a synthetic representation of a human face. The face was presented both above (Experiments 1 and 2) and below (Experiment 3) the face's visual threshold (henceforth called supraliminal and subliminal, respectively). Interocular suppression was used to make the face stimulus invisible (subliminal). In the critical trials of all three experiments, the gaze direction shown on the face was randomly diverted to either the left or to the right. This directed the participant's gaze either towards or away from the location of a target in the RSVP. The perceptual load was always relatively high. It was either set (Experiments 1 and 3) or manipulated (Experiment 2) during the experiment. In all three experiments, an appreciably higher and significant level of target detection was found when an uninformative gaze-cue was congruent with the location of the target. This result, which had only been reported with relatively easy tasks previously, is called the gaze-cueing effect. Our novel findings include showing that: (i) the attentional effect of gaze persists under.high perceptual loads, and (ii) awareness of the gaze stimuli is not required to obtain the gaze-cueing effect.

While the goal- and stimulus-driven systems follow different general principles, they also interplay with each other. However, the mechanism by which the goal- driven system influences the stimulus-driven system is still debated. The present study examined top-down contributions to two components of attention orienting, shifting and disengagement, with an experimental paradigm in which participants held a visual item in short-term memory (STM) and performed a prosaccade task with a manipulation of the gap between fixation offset and target onset. Four experiments showed that the STM content accelerated shifting and impaired disengagement, but the influence on disengagement depended on the utility of STM in guiding attention toward the target. Thus, the use of STM was strategic. Computational models of visual attention were fitted to the experimental data, which suggested that the top-down contributions to shifting was more prominent than those to disengagement. The results indicate that the current modeling framework was particularly useful when examining the contributions of theoretical constructs for the control of visual attention, but it also suggests limitations.",Article,2018,"Yamaguchi, M; Valji, A; Wolohan, FDA",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-GENERAL,JUN,10.1037/xge0000393,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/xge0000393,

BackgroundWorkload capacity measures the efficiency of concurrent information processing and can serve as a gauge of automation usage strategy in speeded decision tasks. The present study used workload capacity analysis to investigate automation usage strategy while information display format and task difficulty were manipulated. Method Subjects performed a speeded judgment task assisted by an automated aid that issued decision cues at varying onset times. Response time distributions were converted to measures of workload capacity. Results Two variants of a workload capacity measure, C-zOR and C-zAND, gave evidence that operators moderated their own decision times both in anticipation of and following the arrival of the aid's diagnosis under difficult task conditions regardless of display format. Conclusion Assistance from an automated decision aid may cause operators to delay their own responses in a speeded decision task, producing joint response time distributions that are slower than optimal. Application Even when it renders its own judgments quickly and with high accuracy, an automated decision aid may slow responses from a user.

TBD,,Jackson,Bailey,921,A singleton distractor updates the inhibitory template for visual marking,"Visual marking, which is based on the assumption that previewing some distractors increases the efficiency of subsequent visual searches, constitutes one of the most efficient inhibitions on visual searches. The preview search task consists of a display of a subset of distractors followed by an additional display containing the remaining distractors and a target. During the preview period, an inhibitory template is thought to be formed, resulting in the prioritization of the subsequently presented items and the inhibition of the previewed items. Although the previous studies have mainly examined the determinants that impair the inhibitory templates resulting in inefficient visual searches, the present study examined the possibility that the template could be updated to increase search efficiency. To this end, we used a preview search task and manipulated the presence of a singleton distractor in the display of the additional items. We examined whether the singleton increased the efficiency of the search performance by determining if the inhibitory template would be updated such that participants would treat the singleton as if it had been previewed. The results demonstrated that the response times were faster with the singleton included, suggesting that an inhibitory template for visual marking could be updated and lead to improved search performance.",Article,2019,"Yamauchi, K; Kawahara, JI",ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA,JAN,10.1016/j.actpsy.2018.11.014,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actpsy.2018.11.014,
TBD,,Jackson,Bailey,922,Reward and Attentional Control in Visual Search,"It has long been known that the control of attention in visual search depends both on voluntary, top-down deployment according to context-specific goals, and on involuntary, stimulus-driven capture based on the physical conspicuity of perceptual objects. Recent evidence suggests that pairing target stimuli with reward can modulate the voluntary deployment of attention, but there is little evidence that reward modulates the involuntary deployment of attention to task-irrelevant distractors. We report several experiments that investigate the role of reward learning on attentional control. Each experiment involved a training phase and a test phase. In the training phase, different colors were associated with different amounts of monetary reward. In the test phase, color was not task-relevant and participants searched for a shape singleton; in most experiments no reward was delivered in the test phase. We first show that attentional capture by physically salient distractors is magnified by a previous association with reward. In subsequent experiments we demonstrate that physically inconspicuous stimuli previously associated with reward capture attention persistently during extinction-even several days after training. Furthermore, vulnerability to attentional capture by high-value stimuli is negatively correlated across individuals with working memory capacity and positively correlated with trait impulsivity. An analysis of intertrial effects reveals that value-driven attentional capture is spatially specific. Finally, when reward is delivered at test contingent on the task-relevant shape feature, recent reward history modulates value-driven attentional capture by the irrelevant color feature. The influence of learned value on attention may provide a useful model of clinical syndromes characterized by similar failures of cognitive control, including addiction, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and obesity.",Article; Proceedings Paper,2012,"Yantis, S; Anderson, BA; Wampler, EK; Laurent, PA","INFLUENCE OF ATTENTION, LEARNING, AND MOTIVATION ON VISUAL SEARCH",,10.1007/978-1-4614-4794-8_5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-4794-8_5,
TBD,,Jackson,Bailey,923,On the distinction between visual salience and stimulus-driven attentional capture,"It is often assumed that the efficient detection of salient visual objects in search reflects stimulus-driven attentional capture. Evidence for this assumption, however, comes from tasks in which the salient object is task relevant and therefore may elicit a deliberate deployment of attention. In 9 experiments, participants searched for a nonsalient target (vertical among tilted bars). In each display, 1 bar was highly salient in a different dimension (e.g., color or motion). When the target and salient elements coincided only rarely, reducing the incentive to attend deliberately to the salient stimuli, response times depended little on whether the target was salient, although some interesting exceptions were observed. It is concluded that efficient selection of an element in visual search does not constitute evidence that the element captures attention in a purely stimulus-driven fashion.",Article; Proceedings Paper,1999,"Yantis, S; Egeth, HE",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-HUMAN PERCEPTION AND PERFORMANCE,JUN,10.1037/0096-1523.25.3.661,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0096-1523.25.3.661,
TBD,,Jackson,Bailey,924,OBJECT CONTINUITY IN APPARENT MOTION AND ATTENTION,"Recent theories of attention have emphasized the role of object-based representations in visual selection. One defining property of any object is spatiotemporal continuity. The present experiments show that the continuity property may underlie two seemingly unrelated perceptual phenomena: attentional capture by abrupt visual onset and the appearance of bistable apparent motion displays. In Experiment 1, observes carried out two visual tasks. In the first task, they reported the appearance of a bistable apparent-motion (or Ternus) display. Whether group or element motion was perceived depended on the duration of the blank interval between successive frames. In the second task, subjects engaged in visual search for a prespecified target, and on each trial one element was briefly flickered off and back on. The degree to which that element captured attention also depended on the duration of the temporal gap. The time course of the gap duration effect in the visual search task was very similar to that for the Ternus display. In Experiment 2, we ruled out the possibility that die presence of an abrupt offset caused the results of Experiment 1. It is argued that the apparent motion and attentional capture phenomena examined here may reflect the operation of the same underlying mechanism: in both cases, a sufficiently long temporal gap disrupts spatiotemporal continuity, thereby fundamentally changing the perceived organization of the display.",Article,1994,"YANTIS, S; GIBSON, BS",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE PSYCHOLOGIE EXPERIMENTALE,JUN,10.1037/1196-1961.48.2.182,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/1196-1961.48.2.182,

Experiments 1 and 2 revealed that attention is captured in visual search by the appearance of a new perceptual object even when the object is equiluminant with its background and thus exhibits no luminance change when it appears.

We report three experiments in which we assess two possible mechanisms for attentional prioritization: a priority queue into which a fixed number of high-priority elements are placed for early servicing during search, and a mechanism that temporarily tags all high-priority elements for early servicing or more frequent sampling. We manipulated the visual quality of interletter confusability of the stimuli to prolong encoding and/or comparison operations; this manipulation led to a decrease in the estimated number of elements serviced with high priority.

In these experiments, no-onset stimuli appeared well before the onset stimulus but were camouflaged by additional line segments rendering the stimuli unidentifiable. B. S. Gibson (1996) claims that the availability of the no-onset stimuli was delayed relative to that of the abrupt onset stimulus because of forward masking. The authors show that forward masking is unlikely to be a significant factor in their experiments, and 3 new experiments are reported that undermine Gibson's masking account.

TBD,,Jackson,Bailey,929,On the generality of the displaywide contingent orienting hypothesis: Can a visual onset capture attention without top-down control settings for displaywide onset?,"The contingent orienting hypothesis (Folk, Remington, & Johnston, 1992) states that attentional capture is contingent on top-down control settings induced by task demands. Past studies supporting this hypothesis have identified three kinds of top-down control settings: for target-specific features, for the strategy to search for a singleton, and for visual features in the target display as a whole. Previously, we have found stimulus-driven capture by onset that was not contingent on the first two kinds of settings (Yeh & Liao. 2008). The current study aims to test the third kind: the displaywide contingent orienting hypothesis (Gibson & Kelsey, 1998). Specifically, we ask whether an onset stimulus can still capture attention in the spatial cueing paradigm when attentional control settings for the displaywide onset of the target are excluded by making all letters in the target display emerge from placeholders. Results show that a preceding uninformative onset cue still captured attention to its location in a stimulus-driven fashion, whereas a color cue captured attention only when it was contingent on the setting for displaywide color. These results raise doubts as to the generality of the displaywide contingent orienting hypothesis and help delineate the boundary conditions on this hypothesis. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

TBD,,Jackson,Bailey,930,What content and context factors lead to selection of a video clip? The heuristic route perspective,"The popularity of watching video clips on mobile devices is rapidly increasing. The providers of such video services have developed mobile capabilities and have worked to increase their video selections. This study investigates the effect of the factors of preview content (the thumbnail and the title) and context (the popularity cue and the serial position) on video selection in a mobile context by adopting dual process theory and the model of attention capture and transfer. We performed a logit transformation on the dependent variable, and then applied generalized least squares (GLS) regression to analyze 206,221 logs and 323 thumbnails and titles of a video service. Image and text- mining techniques were used to ascertain the level of valence and response to content. This study has four main findings: (1) low valence but high arousal of a thumbnail has a positive effect on video selection; (2) high valence and arousal by a title has a positive effect on video selection; (3) the upper serial position of a video clip and a high popularity cue have a positive effect on the video selection; and (4) the length and recency of a video have a positive effect on the video selection. The results of this study suggest practical implications to help the programming and marketing strategy of the video service as well.",Article,2019,"Yoon, SH; Kim, HW",ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH,SEP,10.1007/s10660-019-09355-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10660-019-09355-6,
TBD,,Jackson,Bailey,931,Cue frequency modulates cuing effect either in the presence or in the absence of distractors,"A novel, salient stimulus, even though it is not related to a concurrent goal-directed behavior, powerfully captures people's attention. While this stimulus-driven attentional capture has long been presumed to take place in a purely bottom-up or automatic manner, growing evidence shows that a number of top-down factors modulate the stimulus-driven capture of attention. Recent studies pointed out the cue presentation frequency is such a factor, the capture of attention by a salient, task-irrelevant cue increased as its presentation frequency decreased. Expanding these studies, we investigated how the modulatory effect of the cue frequency differs depending on the level of competition between multiple stimuli. As results, we found that an infrequently presented cue exerted stronger capture effect than a frequently presented cue, either in the presence or in the absence of distractors. Importantly, in the absence of distractors, performance difference elicited by the frequently present cue was due to non-attentional sensory artifacts or decisional noise. However, the same frequent cue evoked genuine attentional effect when multiple distractors accompanied the target, evoking stimulus driven competition. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the effect of attentional cue is modulated by cue frequency, and this modulation is also affected by stimulus-driven competition.",Article,2019,"Yoon, Y; Jung, S; Jeoung, K; Ha, SJ; Kim, D; Han, SW",ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA,FEB,10.1016/j.actpsy.2018.12.008,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actpsy.2018.12.008,
TBD,,Jackson,Bailey,932,Offset masking in a divided visual field study,"A problem in divided visual field studies (especially those using event-related potentials as a dependent measure) is the large number of horizontal eye movements participants make during experimental trials. Past attention research suggests that eye movements to lateralised targets should be significantly reduced using a dynamic, offset mask, causing a reduction in attentional capture. The current study attempted to replicate past divided visual field language studies using offset masking procedures. Using a basic offset procedure, eye movements were not reduced in Experiment 1. However, Experiment 2 did show a significant reduction in eye movements using a new dynamic offset masking procedure. Low accuracy rates were a concern throughout. In conclusion, horizontal eye movements can be reduced with a dynamic offset procedure but the low accuracy rates and the inconsistent behavioural findings throughout the study suggest that further study and refinement of the paradigm is needed.",Article,2009,"Young, KM; Atchley, RA; Atchley, P",LATERALITY,,10.1080/13576500802598108,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13576500802598108,
TBD,,Jackson,Bailey,933,The temporal order judgment paradigm: subcortical attentional contribution under exogenous and endogenous cueing conditions,"The role of subcortical attentional processing was investigated under exogenous and endogenous cueing conditions. As retinotectal projections arise predominantly from the nasal retina i.e., temporal hemifield, subcortical attention should be distributed asymmetrically under monocular viewing conditions with a temporal hemifield advantage. We compared the results of monocular and binocular viewing conditions using a temporal order judgment (TOJ) paradigm. Subjects fixated a centrally located cross and two stimuli were presented with a variable onset asynchrony. Three experiments were conducted: no cue, exogenous cue and endogenous cue. Subjects reported which stimulus seemed to appear first. An effect consistent with subcortical processing was found under exogenous cueing conditions. No such effect was found under endogenous cueing conditions. We believe that subcortical attentional processing in response to an exogenous cue facilitates rapid shifts in attention towards environmental stimuli. We found no evidence for subcortical processing in voluntary directed attention and believe this process to be cortical in nature. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TBD,,Jackson,Bailey,934,Age-Related Changes in Orienting Attention in Time,"Temporal cues guide attentional resources toward relevant points in time, resulting in optimized behavioral performance. Although deficits in aspects of attention have been documented in older adults, it remains unknown whether the critical ability to orient attention in time is affected by normal aging. To address this, younger and older adults participated in a temporally cued target-response experiment while electroencephalographic data were recorded. Three conditions (one detection and two discrimination tasks) were used to manipulate task complexity. Response times show that younger adults, but not older adults, used temporal cues to enhance performance regardless of task complexity. Similarly, alpha band activity (8-12 Hz) and the contingent negative variation preceding targets indicated that only younger adults engaged prestimulus, anticipatory neural mechanisms associated with temporal cues. Overall, these results provide novel evidence that older adults do not use temporal cues to orient attention in time and support an expectation deficit in normal aging.",Article,2011,"Zanto, TP; Pan, P; Liu, H; Bollinger, J; Nobre, AC; Gazzaley, A",JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE,AUG 31,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1149-11.2011,http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1149-11.2011,
TBD,,Jackson,Bailey,935,POP-UP ANIMATIONS Impacts and Implications for Web Site Design and Online Advertising,"Owing to the rapid growth of Internet technologies, Web site design, and online advertisements, pop-up animations have affected and will continue to affect millions of people. Our understanding of the effectiveness and the impact of online advertisements on consumers is still limited from a theoretical perspective, and the empirical evidence continues to be scant. This paper synthesizes and integrates several lab-controlled experiments conducted by the author over an eight-year period (from 1996 to 2003) on the impact of pop-up animations in the Web environment. Human visual attention literature is used to emphasize human cognitive characteristics that prevent or enable us to behave in certain ways when there is animation in our vision field. These studies, together, address the following research questions: (1) As a non-primary information source, does animation decrease viewers' information-seeking performance? (2) If so, do location and timing of pop-up animation matter? (3) As viewers' familiarity with online advertisements increases, do those early animation effects diminish over years? The studies also validate the applicability of visual attention theories in the Web environment and have significant practical implications for online advertising strategies, both for marketers and content providers.",Article; Book Chapter,2006,"Zhang, P",HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION AND MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS: APPLICATIONS,,,,
TBD,,Jackson,Bailey,936,Updating the dual-mechanism model for cross-sensory attentional spreading: The influence of space-based visual selective attention,"Selective attention to visual stimuli can spread cross-modally to task-irrelevant auditory stimuli through either the stimulus-driven binding mechanism or the representation-driven priming mechanism. The stimulus-driven attentional spreading occurs whenever a task-irrelevant sound is delivered simultaneously with a spatially attended visual stimulus, whereas the representation-driven attentional spreading occurs only when the object representation of the sound is congruent with that of the to-be-attended visual object. The current study recorded event-related potentials in a space-selective visual object-recognition task to examine the exact roles of space-based visual selective attention in both the stimulus-driven and representation-driven cross-modal attentional spreading, which remain controversial in the literature. Our results yielded that the representation-driven auditory Nd component (200-400 ms after sound onset) did not differ according to whether the peripheral visual representations of audiovisual target objects were spatially attended or not, but was decreased when the auditory representations of target objects were presented alone. In contrast, the stimulus-driven auditory Nd component (200-300 ms) was decreased but still prominent when the peripheral visual constituents of audiovisual nontarget objects were spatially unattended. These findings demonstrate not only that the representation-driven attentional spreading is independent of space-based visual selective attention and benefits in an all-or-nothing manner from object-based visual selection for actually presented visual representations of target objects, but also that although the stimulus-driven attentional spreading is modulated by space-based visual selective attention, attending to visual modality per se is more likely to be the endogenous determinant of the stimulus-driven attentional spreading.",Article,2021,"Zhao, S; Li, Y; Wang, CZ; Feng, CZ; Feng, WF",HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING,DEC 15,10.1002/hbm.25668,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hbm.25668,
TBD,,Jackson,Bailey,937,Attention capture by eye of origin singletons even without awareness - A hallmark of a bottom-up saliency map in the primary visual cortex,"Human observers are typically unaware of the eye of origin of visual inputs. This study shows that an eye of origin or ocular singleton, e. g., an item in the left eye among background items in the right eye, can nevertheless attract attention automatically. Observers searched for a uniquely oriented bar, i.e., an orientation singleton, in a background of horizontal bars. Their reports of the tilt direction of the search target in a brief (200 ms) display were more accurate in a dichoptic congruent (DC) condition, when the target was also an ocular singleton, than in a monocular (M) condition, when all bars were presented to the same single eye, or a dichoptic incongruent (DI) condition, when an ocular singleton was a background bar. The better performance in DC did not depend on the ability of the observers to report the presence of an ocular singleton by making forced choices in the same stimuli (though without the orientation singleton). This suggests that the ocular singleton exogenously cued attention to its location, facilitating the identification of the tilt singleton in the DC condition. When the search display persisted without being masked, observers' reaction times (RTs) for reporting the location of the search target were shorter in the DC, and longer in the DI, than the M condition, regardless of whether the observers were aware that different conditions existed. In an analogous design, similar RT patterns were observed for the task of finding an orientation contrast texture border. These results suggest that in typical trials, attention was more quickly attracted to or initially distracted from the target in the DC or DI condition, respectively. Hence, an ocular singleton, though elusive to awareness, can effectively compete for attention with an orientation singleton (tilted 20 or 50 degrees from background bars in the current study). Similarly, it can also make a difficult visual search easier by diminishing the set size effect. Since monocular neurons with the eye of origin information are abundant in the primary visual cortex (V1) and scarce in other cortical areas, and since visual awareness is believed to be absent or weaker in V1 than in other cortical areas, our results provide a hallmark of the role of V1 in creating a bottom-up saliency map to guide attentional selection.",Article,2008,"Zhaoping, L",JOURNAL OF VISION,,10.1167/8.5.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1167/8.5.1,
TBD,,Jackson,Bailey,938,Attentional engagement is not sufficient to prevent spatial capture,"What conditions, if any, can fully prevent attentional capture (i.e., involuntary allocation of spatial attention to an irrelevant object) has been a matter of debate. In a previous study, Folk, Ester, and Troemel (Psychonomic Bulletin & Review 16:127-132, 2009) suggested that attentional capture can be blocked entirely when attention is already engaged in a different object. This conclusion relied on the finding that in a search for a known-color target in a rapid serial visual presentation stream, a peripheral distractor with the target color did not further impair target identification performance when a distractor also with the target color that appeared in the stream had already captured attention. In the present study, we argue that this conclusion is unwarranted, because the effects of the central and peripheral distractors could not be disentangled. In order to isolate the effect of the peripheral distractor, we introduced a distractor-target letter compatibility manipulation. Our results showed that the peripheral distractor summoned attention, irrespective of whether attention had just been engaged. We conclude that neither spatially focused attention nor attentional engagement is sufficient to prevent attentional capture.",Article,2014,"Zivony, A; Lamy, D",ATTENTION PERCEPTION & PSYCHOPHYSICS,JAN,10.3758/s13414-013-0543-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/s13414-013-0543-9,
TBD,,Jackson,Bailey,939,Development of Dynamic Attention: Time-Based Visual Selection for Objects in Motion Between 6-12 Years of Age,"By approximately 6 years of age, children can use time-based visual selection to ignore stationary stimuli, already in the visual field and prioritize the selection of newly arriving stimuli. This ability can be studied using preview search, a version of the visual search paradigm with an added temporal component, in which one set of distractors is presented (previewed) before a second set that contains the target item. Preview search is more efficient than if all items are presented simultaneously, suggesting that temporally old objects can be ignored (the preview benefit). In two experiments, we examined the developmental trajectory for time-based visual selection in a sample of 192 6-, 8-, and 12-year-old children (49% female, predominantly White), with adults as controls (75% female, predominantly White), in the United Kingdom. The results showed an absence of the ability to ignore previewed moving distractors in 6-year-olds and confirmed its presence from 8 years of age. However, full development of this ability, which includes maintaining inhibition of previewed items over extended periods, was only present from the age of 12. Individual differences in executive functions, namely inhibition, were associated with preview search efficiency in 6-year-olds and adults. Overall, the results suggest a developmental trajectory in the ability to ignore moving old objects that occurs in two stages and develops later than the ability to ignore previewed stationary objects. The results are discussed in terms of underlying inhibitory mechanisms, in addition to individual differences in the expression of this ability.",Article,2023,"Zupan, Z; Blagrove, EL; Watson, DG",DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY,FEB,10.1037/dev0001462,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001462,
TBD,,Jackson,Bailey,940,"Effective factors of icons searching performance based on visual attention capture for the nuclear power plant
","With the rapid development of digital and intelligent information systems, the display of visual information on interfaces has become an important challenge in the field of human-computer interaction, as well as the human-computer interface of nuclear power plants. This paper examines effective factors affecting visual attention capture based on icons related to the human-computer interface of nuclear power plants. Experiments were conducted on multiple factors of visual search tasks with reference to information features to analyze information display factors affecting visual cognitive performance. The experimental results showed that the three factors, icon shape, feature display, and target position, have a great effect on information searching performance. The main effect of reaction time on three factors all reached a significance level congruent with the effect on fixation time and pupil response. Eye gaze indexes of feature display factors presented an increasing trend, which indicates that the information block spends more time on cognitive processing than icon features in the human-computer interface of nuclear power plants. Pupil diameter was dilated when searching icons under difficult visual cognition conditions, and when searching information blocks, pupils were dilated more than searching single icons. Therefore, shape highlighting of data icons in the human-computer interface of nuclear power plants can effectively improve the attention capture of the operator's visual search, and the ease of icon discrimination is an influential factor in visual attention capture. Two visual search experiments were conducted to analyze ACC, RT, fixation time, and pupil diameter for four features: topological shape, color, complexity, and location of nuclear power icons. Utilizing topological differences in icon shape significantly improves visual search performance, with circular topological shapes performing better than non-circular ones, and information blocks taking more time for cognitive processing than single-icons.image",Article: early access,2023,"Wu, XL; Zhou, C; He, YQ; Li, Q; Yu, S
